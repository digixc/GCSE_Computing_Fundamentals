* What is Sound?

- A /sound/ is literally a vibration that travels through a medium (air) in waves by changing the air pressure as it moves.
- These waves hit our ear drums and our brains convert these into sounds that we can hear and understand.
- The compression and rareification of air can be represented graphically as shown below.
[[file:img/New_Sound1.png]]
- The image from the oscilloscope shows a sound wave with varying amplitudes and frequencies.
- If we were to look at the /y/ values, then we would see that the sound wave is fundamentally analogue in nature.

- When we talk about sound, we often use the terms /volume/ and /pitch/.
- What do these terms actually mean with reference to a sound wave?
- Why would it be problematic to store analogue representations of
  sound on a computer?

- Sound waves are =analogue=, which means continuously
  changing. Anything stored on a computer has to be stored in a
  =digital= format as a series of binary numbers =0's= and =1's=
  with nothing in between.
- In order to store sound in a digital format, there are a few steps that need to be followed:

  1. The Analogue sound must first be captured with an input device *(Microphone)*.
  2. This sound is then converted to an electrical analogue signal.
  3. The signal amplitude *(Height of the wave)* is measured ar regular intervals *(Sampled)*.
  4. The digital data is then rounded to a level *(Quantisation)*.
  5. The digital data can then be stored as a series of *binary numbers*.

- Use online resources to find out how a microphone can capture vibrations in the air and convert them to an analogue electrical signal.
* Sampling

- =Sampling= is the process of converting an analogue sound wave into a digital format, and is a measure of amplitude.
- The accuracy with which an analogue sound wave is converted to a
  digital format depends on two things, =Sample Resolution= and =Sample rate=.
- =Sample Resolution= is the number of bits used to store each sample. This is sometimes also referred to as /Bit Depth/.
- The process involves recording the amplitude of an electrical signal
  at set intervals, rounding the value *(Quantisation)* and converting
  it to binary (typically 16 or 32 bits for sound).
- =Sampling Rate= is the *frequency* with which you record the amplitude
  of the sound, i.e. the number of samples per second. This is usually
  measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 Hz means one sample per second. 1 MHz (Megahertz) means one million times per second.
- The more frequently the sound is sampled, the better the quality and
  smoother the playback will sound.
- For sound, this sampling normally occurs 44,100 times per second. We call this the /Sample Resolution/ and it is normally expressed as 44.1kHz.
- Obviously, the higher the /Sample Rate/ and the larger the /bit depth/, the higher the quality of the resulting audio.

- The image above is a graphical representation of how an analogue
  electrical signal can be sampled and converted to an integer, ready for storing as a binary integer.


* Calculating Sound File and Bit Rate Size

- Sample Rate (Frequency) - The number of samples per second.
- Sample Resolution - The number of bits used to store each sample.
- Seconds - The length in seconds of the whole sound file.
- The file size of a sample in bits = sample rate x sample resolution x number
  of seconds.
- The file size of a sample in bytes = sample rate x sample resolution x number
  of seconds / 8.
#+END_SRC

*For Example*
- =Bit Rate= (amount of Bits per second) = Sampling Rate * Sampling Resolution.
- CD has a sample rate of 44,100Hz, a Resolution of 16 bits.
- A sample rate of 44.1Hz is typically used for CD audio, with a
  sample resolution of 16 bits per sample.
- *Bit Rate* = 44,100 * 16 (bits) = 705,600bps / 1,000 = 705.6Kbps(Kilobits per second).
- =File Size= can then be calculated using the Bit Rate and length of
  the audio (seconds).
- CD has a Bit Rate of 705.6Kbps and has one song which is 3 minutes long:
  - *File Size* = 705.6Kbps * 180 seconds (3 * 60) =
    127008Kb(Kilobits) / 1000 (Mega) / 8 (Bytes) = *15.88MB*
