- At the beginning of this topic we learned about computer systems and
  the relationship with software.
#+BEGIN_SRC
Recap - Software are the programs that control how the computer works.
#+END_SRC
- Software is any program that runs on a computer system. It can be
  grouped into *two main* categories:
 - *System Software:* Programs that are needed to enable the computer
   to function, including the =operating system=, =utilities software=,
   =library routines= and =programming language translators=.
- *Application Software:* Programs that enable a user to perform particular
  tasks like; =word processing=, =spreadsheet calculations=, =databases management=,
  =gaming=, =web browsing=, =mobile phone apps=, =graphics design=,
  =programming=, =music editing= and many more programs for specific
  applications such as =payroll=, =accounts=, =air traffic control=
  etc.

* System Software

** Learn It: What is System Software?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *System Software* is a program that is needed for effective
  communication with the hardware that enables the computer to
  function and for launching application software:
 - *Operating Systems*, such as Windows, IOS and Android,
 - *Utilities Software*, such as antivirus and compression software.
[[file:img/software_system_software.png]]

*The Operating System*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Operating System - A piece of software that acts as an interface between the user and the
hardware, managing all hardware and all other software. If another piece of software is
to be launched, it will be launched from the operating system.
#+END_SRC
- =Operating Systems= are complex pieces of software, often requiring
  many years and many people to develop them.
- The reason that they are complex is simply that =computers are complexed=, with many =hardware components= and =software= that requires
  =management=.
- Some of the many things that are managed by the operating system
  are:
 - *Processors Management* - The operating system decides:
  - Which processes will be carried out by which processor.
  - If multiple processes are running, which one the processor should
    handle next.
  - How long a *time slice* a process should be given, i.e. How long
    before the processor's attention swithches to the next process.
[[file:img/Task_Manager.jpg]]
 - *Memory Management* - The operating system:
  - Loads program and data from backup storage to the main memory.
  - Removes un-needed programs and data to make room for more.
  - Manages *virtual memory* where a part of the secondary storage is
    used an an overflow area for the main memory.
[[file:img/memory_manage.png]]
 - *Management of I/O Devices* - In regards to system input/output devices, the operating system:
  - Acts as a go-between, passing data from input --> application software, or application software --> output.
  - Manages device drivers, which are programs telling the operating system how to communicate with the attached input/output devices,
    for example, a mouse, keyboard ,microphone or a printer.
[[file:img/input_output.jpg]]
 - *Application Management* - The operating system:
  - Communicates between the application software and the hardware.
  - Processes requests from application software for resources, such
    as network connection or a remotely stored file.
  - When an application is run, the OS will allocate space in memory
    for it to be loaded and the job will enter the queue of jobs being
    allocated processor time.
 [[file:img/api-icon.png]]
 - *Security Management* - The operating system can:
  - Control access to a device by setting up passwords for different
    users.
  - Setting different access rights and privileges for different
    users.
  - Automatically download OS updates to ensure security issues are patched.
  - Automatically back up and encrypt data, thereby increasing
    security.
  - Identify all active users currently on a network, manually log out
    users and monitor when/how long each user has logged in over a
    period of time.
 [[file:img/security.jpg]]

*Utility Software*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Utility Software - Programs that helps to =maintain= or =configure= a computer/device.
Many useful ultilities are installed with the OS, for example by freeing up storage
space, removing viruses or ensuring that data is backed up regularly.
#+END_SRC
- Some of these utilities include:
  - *Security Utilities* - Help to keep your data safe by encrypting
    data to protect it from unauthorised individuals from accessing it
    or for secure storage or transmission. The encryption process uses
    an algorithm and a key to transform =plaintext= into =ciphertext=.
[[file:img/padlock.png]]
  - *Disk Organisation* - Help to organise your files into folders and
    perform disk defragmentation (/Organise fragmented  files
    together, to speed up disk access/).
[[file:img/defragmentation.jpg]]
  - *Data Compression* - Help to =reduce the size of a file=, so that it
    can be stored using less space or tramsmitted more quickly. *Automatic update utilities* make sure that any software
    installed on a computer/device is up-to-date.
[[file:img/disk_compression.png]]
  - *File Backup* - Creating a =copy of file=, either on the same disk, or
    on a =backup device= or =cloud service=. Backing up can either be =full=
    or =incremental=:
   - *Full Backup* - Involves creating a copy of all files.
   - *Incremental Backup* - Involves creating a copy of only the files
     that have been created or edited since the last backup.
