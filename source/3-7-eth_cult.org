#+BEGIN_SRC
Ethical Issues - There are several laws that govern the use of computer systems and data.
However, ethics is about good practice and behaving in a morally correct way.
Ethical actions are different from lawful actions. Sometimes actions can be legal, but
are they ethical?
#+END_SRC 
*Ethical Issues*
- Computers have become so widespread that it is difficult to imagine a world without them.
- How much of an impact have they had on our culture and society?
*For Example:*
    - Ethical issues are ignored with our ever increasing use of technology.
    - It is becoming more socially accpetable to use technology online to be rude or bully strangers that we haven't even met.
    - Has technology made us a more or less caring society?
*Q1. Think of some other ways in which computer technology has changed the way in which we live and work?*
- *There are some benefits:*
    - Many more people are now able to communicate with a much larger world through the use of social media, communication is possible
    between countires and people have access to a ealth of information through the Internet.
    - There is also benefits to safety as it is easier than it used to be for a person who is in danger to seek help.
- *Here are some drawbacks:*
    - Mobile phones make it much easier for people to put their own privacy at risk, since photos and personal information can be
    shared on social media platforms.
    - There are ethical issues relating to equality of access to technology, where more advanced technology is not available to
    less affluent people which creates what is known as the digital divide.
*In this topic we will cover the following aspects:*
- Recent Technological Developments.
- Internet Privacy.
- Censorship and Surveillance.
- Social Consequences.
- Cyber Security.
- Wireless Networking.
- Mobile Technologies.
- Cloud Storage.
- Wearable Technologies.
- Computer Based Implants.
- Health Impacts.
- The Digital Divide.
- Environmental Issues.
- Legal Issues.

#+BEGIN_SRC
Technological Developments - Computer technology is vital in today's society. Technology
has given us many benefits such as 5G, Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, Artificial
Intelligence, Regenerative medicine, Driverless vehicles, Cryptocurrency, Quantum
computing, Digital Assistants, Robots, Smart Devices and automation are a few of the many
technologies available. However, technology also has a wide variety of negative impacts,
such as health issues, less social interactions, over reliance on technology, environmental
pollution and increased use of energy to power the huge number of electronic devices. 
#+END_SRC 
*Recent Technological Developments*
- *The Mixed Reality(MR):*
  - *Mixed Reality* is the =combination= of *twin technologies* of =Virtual Reality (VR)= and =Augmented Reality (AR)=.
  - Mixed reality (MR), *sometimes referred* to as =polyplexity (PP)=, is the *merging* of =real= and =virtual worlds= to *produce* /new environments/ and /visualisations/ where =physical= and =digital= *objects co-exist* and *interact* in =real-time=.
  - *Mixed reality* not only *takes place* in the =physical world= or the =virtual world=, but is a =hybrid of reality= and =virtual reality=, *encompassing both* =Augmented Reality= and =Augmented Virtuality= via =immersive technology=.
  - The *first immersive mixed reality system*, providing enveloping /sight, sound/, and /touch/ was the =Virtual Fixtures platform= developed at the =U.S. Air Force's Armstrong Laboratories= in the /early 1990s/.
  - *In a study published in 1992*, the =Virtual Fixtures project= at the U.S. Air Force =demonstrated= for the first time that =human performance= could be =significantly amplified= by the *introduction* of *spatially* /registered virtual objects overlaid on top of a person's direct view of a real physical environment/.
[[file:img/Mixed_Reality.png]]
- *Artificial Intelligence(AI):*
  - With the onset of Artificial Intelligence, the machines are programmed to conduct the tasks that were restricted to the human mind. The artificial intelligence-based software can think intelligently like humans.
  - The subsets of artificial intelligence like machine learning and
    deep learning are gaining constant popularity among
    businesses. Now, more and more companies are taking machine
    learning development services as a necessity.
  - Artificial intelligence improvises business tasks and makes them simple. It has provided the web app developers a brilliant support to experiment. This has made AI to reach healthcare, banking, education, mathematics, etc.

- *IBM Deep Blue:*
  - *Deep Blue* was a =chess-playing computer= developed by *IBM*. It is known for being the =first computer chess-playing system= to *win both a chess game* and a *chess match* against a =reigning world champion=.
  - *Deep Blue* =won= its =first game= against a *world champion* on the =10th February 1996=, when it =defeated= /Garry Kasparov/ in game one of a =six-game match=. *However*, =Kasparov= *won three* and *drew two* of the following five games, =defeating Deep Blue= by a *score of 4–2*.
  - *Deep Blue* was then =heavily upgraded=, and *played Kasparov again* in =May 1997=.
  - Deep Blue *won game six*, therefore =winning= the *six-game rematch 3½–2½* and becoming the =first computer system= to *defeat* a =reigning world champion=.
  - *Kasparov* =accused IBM of cheating= and *demanded a rematch*. /IBM refused and dismantled Deep Blue/.
[[file:img/DeepBlue.png]]
- *Google DeepMind AlphaGo:*
  - *AlphaGo* is a =computer program= that *plays* the *board game* =Go=.
  - It was developed by Alphabet Inc.'s =Google DeepMind= in London.
  - AlphaGo had =three far more powerful successors=, called /AlphaGo Master, AlphaGo Zero/ and /AlphaZero/.
  - *In October 2015*, the original =AlphaGo= became the =first computer Go program= to =beat= a =human professional Go player= without handicaps on a full-sized 19×19 board.
  - *In March 2016*, it =beat= *Lee Sedol* in a /five-game match/, the =first time a computer Go program= has *beaten* a =9-dan professional=.
  - *Although,* it =lost= to *Lee Sedol* in the =fourth game=, Lee resigned in the final game, giving a /final score of 4 games to 1 in favour of AlphaGo/.
  - In *recognition* of the *victory*, =AlphaGo= was /awarded an honorary 9-dan by the Korea Baduk Association/.
  - *At the 2017 Future of Go Summit*, its *successor* =AlphaGo Master,* =beat Ke Jie=, the =world No.1 ranked player= at the time, in a three-game match (/the even more powerful AlphaGo Zero already existed but was not yet announced/).
  - After this, =AlphaGo= was /awarded professional 9-dan by the Chinese Weiqi Association/.

- *The Internet of Things (IoT):*
  - *Internet of things* /covers the broad categories of devices/ that are =connected to the Internet=.
  - These *applications* have *spread* to both the =customer= and =industrial domains=. In the area of safety and customer experience, IoT is witnessing exponential demands.
  - *Every second* =over 127= /new devices/ will be =connected= to the =Internet=, according to David Evan’s calculations (/former researcher of CISCO/). This gives an idea about the constantly increasing reach of *IoT*.
  - It is =estimated= that =over 90% automobiles= by *2020* /will be IoT enabled/. Moreover, according to the data found by Statista, there were around =23.14 billion devices= in *2018* and the =number= /will reach/ =26.66 billion by 2019=.
[[file:img/IoT_Graph.png]]
- *Regenerative Medicine:*
  - Though it may sound like *science fiction*, doctors are already =producing made-to-order body parts=. *To get started*, doctors *scrape cells* /off the body part in question/ and =grow them in a petri dish=. *In time*, the =body part grows= strong enough that it can be =implanted inside the patient.=
  - One company, *Organovo*, has =developed= a * 3D printer* capable of =printing body parts=. *Over time*, this *new technology* will become =increasingly mainstream=, /providing patients with lifesaving organ replacements/.
[[file:img/Regenative_Medicine.png]]
- *Driverless vehicles:*
  - Automakers like Tesla, General Motors and Volvo have already
    developed semi-autonomous vehicles. But self-driving technology is
    rapidly evolving. General Motors announced that it will launch a
    car that has no steering wheel or pedals by 2019.
  - Uber, meanwhile, is leading the push for pilotless flying vehicles, and has teamed up with NASA to develop an air-traffic-control system. Uber is also working with aircraft manufacturers to develop prototypes, with the intention of launching a beta program in 2020.
  - These cars will be controlled by AI programs.

- *Now imagine this situation:*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Your car is driving at a moderate speed down a road. It turns a corner and there are five
pedestrians standing in the road. Even if the car were to apply its brakes, it would still
hit them, so the only way to avoid killing the pedestrians is to mount the pavement.
Unfortunately, there is a single pedestrian standing on the pavement, who will be killed
if the car chooses to swerve.
#+END_SRC 
1. Should the car continue in a straight line and kill 5 people, or should it make a decision to intentionally kill a single individual?
2. Write down what you think the car should do and why?
3. If it was later discovered that the car should have been driving more slowly, who is to blame? Is it the fault of the owner of the car, the manufacturer of the car, the programmer of the car, or the program?
4. Should computers be programmed to always serve humanity and therefore choose options that lead to the greatest good?

Wireless (Wi-Fi) Wireless Fidelity – Like mobile phones and TVs, wireless networks
use radio waves to transmit data. Microwaves are a type of radiowave that consist
of electromagnetic radiation travelling in waves with a frequency higher that
1 gigahertz (1GHz to 300GHz per second). Data is transmitted across the network in
frequency bands of between 2.4 and 5GHz.
The bands are split into numbered channels that each cover a small frequency range.

Cloud Storage - Is a cstorage method in which data is stored on remote servers and accessed
from the internet, or "cloud." It is maintained, operated and managed by a cloud storage
service provider.
#+END_SRC 
*What is Cloud Storage?*
- Cloud storage involves uploading data to a remote server or computer via an Internet connection.
- This data storage system is maintained by a third party, for example: Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Apple iCloud.
- Instead of saving data on your computer's hard drive or other local storage device, you save it in a remote storage facility, and access it via the Internet.
- Clients pay for online storage space to which they can upload data such as photos, videos, music and documents.

*There are several advantages of cloud storage:*
  - There is a reduced risk of physical damage.
  - You can access the data anytime and from anywhere in the World.
  - You can share the data with other people in different locations.
  - Backups are no longer an issue, as it is the responsibility of the provider to keep the data safe.
  - It is a secure form of storage - As long as the password is kept private.
  - Storage capacity on your local machine is freed up, giving you more storage space.

*There are also some disadvantages of cloud storage:*
  - You must have an Internet connection to access your data.
  - Data is at risk of hacking.
  - Basic storage plans are usually free, but larger storage capacities often require payment.
  - The speed at which you can access your data is limited by your Internet connection, therefore it might take a long time to upload and download large files.

- *Wearable Technology* is technology you can =wear=, such as =smart
  watches=, =activity trackers= and =smart textiles= (/for example,
  those used during a yoga class to track your positions and monitor
  how long you hold the pose for/).
- Wearable technologies can include items that can:
  - Be worn to monitor your movement, number of
    steps, time spent sleeping, sitting or standing and also tell you
    how to live a healthier life.
  - Be worn by a swimmer to measure the number of kick-turns, breath
    counts and stroke effecicency. Or for a runner to track their
    distance, speed and heart rate during a run.
  - Tighten your trainers automatically at the touch of a button, like
    Nike's replica Marty McFly's Mag Trainers.
- *Some of these devices*, as well as your =smartphone= enable your =movements= to be =tracked= by your /friends/ and /family/, or by /complete strangers/ *without your knowledge*.

Computer Based Implants - Implants are typically an integrated circuit device or RFID
transponder encased in silicate glass and implanted in the body under the skin.
#+END_SRC 
*What are Computer Based Implants?*
- *Computer Based Implants have been used in many different fields of medicine:
  - *Cochlear Implants* - These have been successfully used in restoring partial hearing to profoundly deaf people.
  - *Pace Makers* - Heart implants may also include electrodes for regulating heartbeats, and warn of possible heart attacks and monitor the effects of medical treatments.
  - *RFID Chips* - Can be inserted under the skin enable users to authorise actions such as, door access, security, contactless payments, access Bluetooth devices or send biometric information via Bluetooth.
*Risks of Computer Based Implants:*
- Risks of implants inducing malignant tumors.
- Implants may be a potential major breach of privacy, as it could contain biometric data, information about illnessess and hacking such a device could be dangerous.
- Many implanted devices need to be capable of being reprogrammed and they have to collect monitoring data from the patients which can be read by medical staff or by a malicious person trying to hack the implanted device.

The Digital Divide - A digital divide is any uneven distribution in the access to, use of,
or impact of information and communication technologies between any number of distinct
groups; these groups may be defined based on social, geographical, or geopolitical criteria,
or otherwise.
#+END_SRC 
*What is The Digital Divide?*
- *People* =without access to technology=, or =who do not know how to use technology=, are at a *disadvantage* to those who do. /This is known as the digital divide/.
- *There is* a =digital divide= *between* =countries= and *also between* =individuals= /within the same country/.
- *For example*, in =England=, there are =areas without= *high speed Internet access*.
- The digital divide can have a =huge impact= on *people* who have =little= or =limited access= to *digital technologies*.
- Having =low IT literacy= can =lead= to =low-paid employment= or even =being unemployed=.
- The =Office for National Statistics= has =calculated= that in *2015* =over 3.5 million households= in the =UK= *had no Internet access*.
- *In 2013*, it was =estimated= by the =charity Age UK= that it =costs households= *without Internet access* an =extra £276 per year=, /because they cannot shop or pay bills online/.
- *38%* of those =who are not online= are also *unemployed* but:
  - /From 2013 they have had to prove that they are actively searching for jobs online using the government’s Universal Jobmatch website./
  - /If they do not do this, their benefits can be stopped. Therefore they have to travel to libraries for access./
- *Some of the main causes of the digital divide in the UK are:*
  - *Money* - People need money to access the internet and buy the latest devices, such as computers, smartphones and tablets.
  - *Location* - Access to network coverage and high-speed broadband can vary greatly depending on where you live. Most large towns and cities have good network coverage and access, but rural areas can have limited or no coverage. Without these connections, the internet can be slow or non-existent.
  - *IT Literacy* - Knowing how to use technology empowers people to make the most of it. People who don't know how to use computers and the internet do not have the opportunities that IT-literate people do.
  - *Internet Access* - The Internet provides many opportunities for people who want to access online shopping, banking and job adverts. Students with internet access at home can research or revise with online help. Many universities and schools offer courses online. Social networking helps people make connections and stay in touch.

- The =impact of digital technology= on the =environment= has been both =positive= and =negative=.
- *Environmental issues* include the =carbon footprint= and =waste products= that *result* from =manufacturing computer systems.=
- But these are =often outweighed= by the =positive effects= on the environment of *using* =computerised systems= to /manage processes that might otherwise of generated more pollution./

Legal Issues - The law can affect the way that computer systems are developed, how they
are used and how they are disposed of.
#+END_SRC 
*Legal Issues*
- *There are several laws that you should be aware of in the UK:*
  - The Data Protection Act 1998.
  - The Data Protection Act 2018.
  - The Computer Misuse Act 1990.
  - The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.
  - The Freedom of Information Act 2000.
  - Creative Commons Licencing.

*The Data Protection Act 1998*
[[file:img/DPA_8_Principles.png]]
- *The Data Protection Act 1998* has =eight principles= that *apply* to =personal data= of any =individual=. 
- *In May 2018*, the =General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)= was introduced and *replaced* the *Data Protection Act*.
- The eight principles of data protection laid out in the 1998 Data Protection Act will remain relevant, with changes to some of the key principles. 
- If an organisation stores personal data of living individuals, that data must comply with the following eight principles:
 1. Data must be processed fairly and lawfully.
 2. Data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive.
 3. Data must be accurate and up to date.
 4. Data must not be retained for longer than necessary.
 5. Data can only be used for the purpose for which it was collected.
 6. Data must be kept secure.
 7. Data must be handled in accordance with people's rights.
 8. Data must not ne transferred outside of the EU without adequate
    protection.

*The Data Protection Act 2018 is the UK’s implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Click [[https://www.gov.uk/data-protection][here]] for details*
- The six principles of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulations) are similar in many ways to the eight principles of the Data Protection Act. While the six principles of GDPR do not include individuals’ rights or overseas transfers, these are included elsewhere in GDPR.
- *The six principles of The Data Protection Act 2018 are that data must be treated in a way that is:*
 1. *Lawful, fair and transparent* - /There has to be legitimate grounds for collecting the data and it must not have a negative effect on the person or be used in a way they wouldn’t expect./
 2. *Limited for its purpose* - /Data should be collected for specified and explicit purposes and not used in a way someone wouldn’t expect./
 3. *Adequate and necessary* - /It must be clear why the data is being collected and what will be done with it. Unnecessary data or information without any purpose should not be collected./
 4. *Accurate* - /Reasonable steps must be taken to keep the information up to date and to change it if it is inaccurate./
 5. *Not kept longer than needed* - /Data should not be kept for longer than is needed, and it must be properly destroyed or deleted when it is no longer used or goes out of date./
 6. *Integrity and confidentiality* - /Data should be processed in a way that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing, loss, damage or destruction, and kept safe and secure./

*The Computer Misuse Act 1990*
- *The Computer Misuse Act 1990* was *introduced* to =stop hacking= and =cyber crime=. It introduced *three new offences:*
[[file:img/Computer_Misuse_Act_1990.png]]
- *This act* also *applies* to /making, supplying/ or /obtaining anything/ which can be =used= in a =computer misuse offence=.

*The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988*
- This act was =originally designed= to *protect* the =creators= of /books, music, videos/ and /software/ from having their work =illegally copied=.
[[file:img/Copyright_Design_1988.png]]
- *However*, although a piece of software such as an /applications package, game/ or /operating system/ =is protected=, =algorithms= are not eligble for protection. So if you come up with a new improved searching algorithm, you cannot stop others from using it.

*The Freedom of Information Act 2000*
- The *increased use* of =computerised systems= and =digital communications= has led to the =enactment of new laws= to *control* that usage.
- *Personal data* about everyone, including *financial information*, /is held online/.
[[file:img/Freedom_2000_Info.png]]

*Creative Commons Licencing*
- *Creative commons* is an =organisation= that =provides licences= allowing the *creators of copyright works* to =give= the =public permission= to /share/ and /use this work/ *under certain conditions.*

*** Platinum - Ethical and Legal (8 Marks)
1. Chess is a two-player board game. Every year there is a competition to find the best chess-playing computer program. In 2011 the chess program Rybka was accused of having copied program code from other chess-playing computer programs and was disqualified from the World Computer Chess Championship. Prize money won in previous years had
   to be returned.
  - a) To date, it has never been proven or disproven that Rybka contained copied program code. State two reasons why it could be difficult to prove if program code in Rybka had been copied from another program.
  - b) The program code that Rybka was accused of copying was open-source, this means that it was publically available so that anyone could look at it. The programmers of Rybka could have tried to prove they were innocent by publishing all their program code. This would allow people to compare it to the code they were accused of copying and see that it was different. Assuming that there was not any copied program code in Rybka, state one reason why the programmers might not want to do this.
2. Some people believe that copying program code without permission should not be a crime. State one reason why they might believe this and state one reason why some people would disagree with them.
3. Many organisations provide free public access to a wireless network.
  - a) Explain three ethical, legal or data privacy issues that an organisation should be aware of when allowing this access.
