- *George Boole (1815 - 1864)* was an English mathematician and the author of *“Mathematical Analysis of Logic”* written in 1847, in which he introduced the world to =Boolean logic=.
- *Boolean logic* is very important to computer science because of the
  way in which computers work.
- Computers operate as =digital devices= using =transistors= that are in
  one of two states, =on= or =off=.
- The transistors either transmit an electrical current (/on/) or they
  do not (/off/).
- These two states of =on= or =off= can be used to represent the =two
  conditions= of =True= (on) or =False= (off).
- These =two states= are also =represented= by the =binary= digits =1= and =0=.
- The four logic gates you need to know and understand, =NOT=, =AND=, =OR=
  and =XOR= logic gates.
** Boolean Logic in Programming
- Understanding how binary logic works will help you develop your
  programming skills.
- In programming code, you will most often use quite =complexed
  Boolean expressions= to control conditions within loops and
  selection statements.
- *For example:*
  - /WHILE NOT EndOfFile AND NOT FileFound..../
  - /IF (Y <= 20) OR (CharNum > LenOfString) THEN..../
- You will have already used a repeat loop (WHILE) to continue to run
  a program until the user types either "Yes" or "No".
- The WHILE loop would look like the following example, with the
  condition at the end:
#+BEGIN_SRC
REPEAT
   | 
   |
   |
UNTIL     (response = "No")     OR     (response = "Yes")
          Boolean Expression           Boolean Expression
#+END_SRC

- Each *Boolean expression* can be replaced with a letter which is
  called a *Boolean variable*.
#+BEGIN_SRC
REPEAT
           (response = "No")     OR     (response = "Yes")
            Replace with the             Replace with the
           Boolean variable, X          Boolean variable, Y

UNTIL              X             OR             Y
#+END_SRC
- Boolean Data Types are just the same in programming, they are either
  *True* or *False*. So with the example above, X and Y will either be
  True or False.
- This can be represented as True=1 and False=0 in electronic circuits as open and closed.

** Logic Gates and Truth Tables
#+BEGIN_SRC
Truth Tables - Each of the NOT, AND, OR and XOR gates can represented by a truth table
showing the output given for each possible input or combination of inputs.
Inputs are usually given algebraic letters such as A, B and C and output is usually
represented by P or Q.
Logic gates are often displayed using logic diagrams and truth tables.
Truth tables show how the input(s) of a logic gate relate to its output.
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC
Compound Statement - Transistors can be combined into logic circuits in order to solve
problems using Boolean logic. When multiple Boolean operators are used in a statement,
they work together to examine if several conditions are true or false.

- You can click on the input buttons to see what each of the following
  gates do.

- The first logic gate is the =NOT= gate, sometimes called an =inverter=.

#+END_HTML

- Then there is the AND gate
#+BEGIN_HTML
<object data="js/AND.html" width='200px' height='100px'></object>
#+END_HTML
- Then there is the OR gate
#+BEGIN_HTML
<object data="js/OR.html" width='200px' height='100px'></object>
#+END_HTML
- This last one is called an XOR gate
#+BEGIN_HTML

#+BEGIN_SRC
Logic Circuits - Logic gates are often combined to create logic circuits that can
perform more complex operations.
A logic circuit is designed with multiple logic gates, so that it can take a variety
of inputs (can be hundreds) and process them to allow decisions to be made according
to the various inputs.
They are the basic building blocks of many electronic circuits found in computer RAM,
household devices, games consoles, and sensors in a cars or plane, or at different
points in a production line in a factory.
#+END_SRC
** Boolean Expression Operators
- You will be expected to understand and use the following Boolean expression operators:
 - =Overbar= to represent the =NOT= gate.
 - =.= to represent the =AND= gate.
 - =+= to represent the =OR= gate.
 - =⊕= to represent the =XOR= gate.
- For example the expression =(A AND B) OR (NOT C)= would be represented as: =A . B + C̅=
