** Learn It: What are Protocols?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *Network Protocols* are the =rules= and =standards= that =govern= how a
  *devices communicates on a network*.
- *Network protocols* govern all aspects of network communication from
  /sending/ and /receiving messages/, to /formatting files/ for different types of messages.
- *Without protocols*, =communications= between computers devices =would be impossible=.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- *A network protocol will specify, for example:*
  - The format of data packets.
  - The addressing system.
  - Error-checking procedures used.

** Learn It: Ethernet Protocol
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Protocols.png]]
*Ethernet Protocols*
- The *Ethernet* refers to a =family of related networking rules= or =protocols= widely used in =Local Area Networks (LAN)=.
- This is =set of rules= that =governs= how =data frames= are =formatted= ready for =transmission= between =computers= on the =same network=.
  - /This is similar to polite human conversation, nodes wait until the connection is quiet before attempting to 'Speak' or transmit./
  - /Two nodes attempting to transmit simultaneously will stop and each will wait a random period of time before re-attempting transmission./
- Each Ethernet device has a unique =48-bit MAC address= and these addresses specify the =source= and =destination= of each frame. These are are usually displayed as a 12-digit hexadecimal number.
- All *new computers* have =Ethernet interfaces built-in= to motherboards, and older machines can be fitted with NIC cards.
- The *standard network cable* used with Ethernet are often referred to as =Ethernet cables=. It uses =twisted-pair copper= cabling or =fibre-optics=.

** Learn It: Wi-Fi
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Wi_Fi.png]]
*Wi-Fi*
- Wi-Fi is also a =family of related rules= or =protocols= that allow /electronic devices/ to =connect=, =control= and =transmit data= on a
  *wireless local area network (WLAN)*.
- Devices which can use Wi-Fi technology include; /personal computers, games consoles, smartphones, digital cameras, smart home devices/ and /tablet computers./
- *Wi-Fi compatible devices* can connect to the Internet via a =wireless LAN= and a =Wireless Access Point (WAP)=.
- The *WAP receives data* from a network via its =physical connection=. The =transmitter= then =converts= this =data= into =radio waves= which are then =transmitted=.
- *Any device* on the network =receives= this =radio signal= via a =Wi-Fi adaptor= which allows it to =communicate= or =download data= from the
  data source.
- This also works in the reverse direction when a device wishes to send data over the network to another computer.
- In 1999, the *Wi-Fi Alliance* was established to set the *international standards* for network connections.

** Learn It: TCP/IP and UDP Protocols
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *TCP/IP* consists of =two very important= and =separate protocols= which dictate how data is sent between networks.
*The two protocols serve the following functions:*
1. *Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)* is a =transport layer protocol= that sets the =rules= for how devices connect on the network. Itâ€™s in charge of =splitting= the =data= into =smaller
   numbered pieces= called =packets= that allows it to be transported. *TCP* then =reassembles= the =packets= back into the =original data= once they reach the receiving device. It also
   =detects= =errors= and =resends= *lost packets*. The sending device gets a =confirmation= when the *transfer is complete*.
2. *Internet Protocol (IP)* is an =Internet layer protocol= that is =responsible= for =packet switching=. IP is the =standard= set of =rules= used to ensure that computers on the Internet =send
   information= to the =correct address=. Every =computer= on a =network= must have its own =unique address= known as an =IP address=. The IP protocol =identifies= the =location= of a device on
   the Internet and =routes= the *individual packets* from source to the destination via =routers=.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- *User Datagram Protocol (UDP)* uses a =simple connectionless transmission model= where data is =split= into =packets without numbering them=. They are =read= by the =receiving device= in the order that they arrive - *Even if that's not the order they were sent*. With UDP, computer applications can send messages referred to as =datagrams= to other hosts on an IP network. It is an alternative to TCP but has =no error checking= or =correction=.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
*TCP Versus UDP*
- UDP is suitable for applications that need =fast, efficient transmission=, *e.g. Online gaming sessions, live video streaming* /(Video quality can be poor due to missing packets, but is faster
  and smoother for live video streaming)./
- TCP is better when you need a =reliable connection=, for example, *downloading files, sending data* or *emails*. /Missing data packets could cause files to become corrupt and unreadable./
*Other Protocols*
