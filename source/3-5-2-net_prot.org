** Learn It: What are Protocols?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn

- *Network Protocols* are the =rules= and =standards= that =govern= how a
  *devices communicates on a network*.
- *Network protocols* govern all aspects of network communication from
  /sending/ and /receiving messages/, to /formatting files/ for different types of messages.
- *Without protocols*, =communications= between computers devices =would be impossible=.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- *A network protocol will specify, for example:*
  - The format of data packets.
  - The addressing system.
  - Error-checking procedures used.

:PROPERTIES:

[[file:img/Protocols.png]]
*Ethernet Protocols*
- The *Ethernet* refers to a =family= of *related networking rules* or =protocols= widely used in =Local Area Networks= *(LAN)*.
- This is =set of rules= that =governs= how =data frames= are =formatted= ready for =transmission= between =computers= on the =same network=.
  - /This is similar to polite human conversation, nodes wait until the connection is quiet before attempting to 'Speak' or transmit./
  - /Two nodes attempting to transmit simultaneously will stop and each will wait a random period of time before re-attempting transmission./
- Each Ethernet device has a unique =48-bit MAC address= and these addresses specify the =source= and =destination= of each frame. These are are usually displayed as a 12-digit hexadecimal number.
- All *new computers* have =Ethernet= interfaces *built-in* to *motherboards*, and older machines can be fitted with NIC cards.
- The *standard network cable* used with Ethernet are often referred to as =Ethernet cables=. It uses =twisted-pair copper= cabling or =fibre-optics=.

** Learn It: Wi-Fi
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Wi_Fi.png]]
*Wi-Fi*
- Wi-Fi is also a =family= of *related rules* or =protocols= that allow /electronic devices/ to =connect=, =control= and =transmit data= on a
  *wireless local area network (WLAN)*.
- Devices which can use Wi-Fi technology include; /personal computers, games consoles, smartphones, digital cameras, smart home devices/ and /tablet computers./
- *Wi-Fi compatible devices* can connect to the Internet via a =wireless LAN= and a =Wireless Access Point (WAP)=.
- The *WAP receives data* from a network via its =physical connection=. The =transmitter= then =converts= this =data= into =radio waves= which are then =transmitted=.
- *Any device* on the network =receives= this =radio signal= via a =Wi-Fi adaptor= which allows it to =communicate= or =download data= from the
  data source.
- This also works in the reverse direction when a device wishes to send data over the network to another computer.
- In 1999, the *Wi-Fi Alliance* was established to set the *international standards* for network connections.

** Learn It: TCP/IP and UDP Protocols
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *TCP/IP* consists of *two very important* and =separate protocols= which dictate how data is sent between networks.
*The two protocols serve the following functions:*
1. *Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)* is a =transport layer protocol= that sets the =rules= for how devices connect on the network. It’s in charge of =splitting= the =data= into =smaller numbered pieces= called =packets= that allows it to be transported. *TCP* then =reassembles= the =packets= back into the =original data= once they reach the receiving device. It also =detects= =errors= and =resends= *lost packets*. The sending device gets a =confirmation= when the *transfer is complete*.
2. *Internet Protocol (IP)* is an =Internet layer protocol= that is =responsible= for =packet switching=. IP is the =standard= set of =rules= used to ensure that computers on the Internet =send information= to the =correct address=. Every *computer* on a *network* must have its own =unique address= known as an =IP address=. The IP protocol =identifies= the *location* of a device on the Internet and =routes= the *individual packets* from source to the destination via =routers=.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- *User Datagram Protocol (UDP)* uses a =simple= *connectionless transmission model* where data is =split= into =packets= *without numbering them*. They are =read= by the =receiving device= in the order that they arrive - *Even if that's not the order they were sent*. With UDP, computer applications can send messages referred to as =datagrams= to other hosts on an IP network. It is an alternative to TCP but has =no error checking= or =correction=.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
*TCP Versus UDP*
- UDP is suitable for applications that need =fast, efficient transmission=, *e.g. Online gaming sessions, live video streaming* /(Video quality can be poor due to missing packets, but is faster
  and smoother for live video streaming)./
- TCP is better when you need a =reliable connection=, for example, *downloading files, sending data* or *emails*. /Missing data packets could cause files to become corrupt and unreadable./
*Other Protocols*

#+END_HTML
*Data Packets*
- We have already learned that most networks use TCP/IP as the network protocol, or set of rules for communication between devices, and the rules of TCP/IP require information to be split into small pieces called =packets= that =contain= both a =segment of data= to be transferred and the =address= where the data is to be sent.
- *Files* could be *million of bytes* in size, which is =too large= to send in one go, which is why =files= are =broken up= into =packets=.
- *Each packet* has an average size of about =1.5KB=.
- *IP addresses* =identify= each connected device.
- *MAC addresses* =identify= /Routers, default gateways/ and /device NICs./
[[file:img/IP_Packet.png]]
- *A Packet Consists of:* 
  - A *Header* containing the =source= and =destination addresses= and the =position= of this packet in the complete message or file.
  - The *Body* containing part of the complete message =data= /(known as the payload)./
  - A *Footer* /(also known as the trailer)/ that informs the receiving device that it has reached the end of the packet and can also be used for =error checking= to ensure the complete packet has been delivered intact.
*Packet Switching*
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- The *packets* are then *sent out* on their various journeys to their recipient computer. They *do not* all follow the *same route*. In fact, they do not all necessarily arrive in the correct order, but because they are labelled the receiving computer can put the packages back together in the correct order.
- The delivery of the packets is accomplished by devices called =Routers=. The *routers direct* the packets along the *best route* depending on network traffic.
