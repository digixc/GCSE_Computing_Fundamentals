** Learn It: The Importance of Network Security
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)* - A =unique number= that =identifies= every *computer/device* connected to the Internet. *No two IP
  addresses* are the *same*.
- If your computer =requests= a web page, your computer/device's IP address specifies where that web page should ultimately be delivered.
- *Networks* are much =more vulnerable= to *hackers* than =standalone computers/devices=, since a *hacker* can *access* a network through =one computer/device= in order to gain access to other devices on the same network.
- This can have =serious implications= for an *organisation*, resulting in /data theft, corruption of data, denial of service,/ or /other damage caused by malware/ being installed on *network servers*.
- *Security* on a network is =very important= to *prevent unauthorised* =access= to data, =misuse= or =modification= of data including installing /viruses and other malware/.
- With more data being shared, more data is falling into the wrong hands. *Organisations* are now *hiring dedicated professionals* to keep =data secure=, as breaches can =damage= an *organisation's profitability*
  and *reputation*.
- Even an *individual* can lose out financially if their =credit card= details are =stolen=.

** Learn It: Methods of keeping a Network Secure
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
*Network security has two main goals:*
 - To prevent *unauthorised* people from *accessing resources*.
 - To allow *authorised* people /to/ *access the resources* they need.
*Methods used to maintain network security include:*
- Authentication.
- Encryption.
- Firewalls.
- MAC Address Filtering.

** Learn It: Authentication
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
#+BEGIN_SRC
Measures put in place to ensure that a person trying to access data on a network, are who
they say they are! I.E. a genuine authorised user.
#+END_SRC
[[file:img/Authent_Img.png]]
*Authentication can take place in a number of ways:*
*Password Protection*
- In a networked environment like Bourne Grammar School or a business, there are *many computers/devices* being *used* by *more* than *one person*.
- Students may or may not have their =own computers/devices= and the *easiest* way to *stop unauthorised access* to your computer or your files is to use a combination of a =Username= and =Password=.
- Passwords should =never= be *shared* with other people, *written* down and should be *strong*, this means not easy to guess (/6-8 characters, upper/lower case letters, symbols and numbers/).
- Some companies including Bourne Grammar School =make= students =change= *their passwords every month/term*.
- For =additional security= against people =trying= lots of different passwords to *get into* someone else's account, the =account= can be =locked= after a *certain number of attempts*.
*User Access Levels*
- User access levels can be =set= for /disks, folders/ and /files/, so that *users* can *only access* what they are *allowed* to access.
- Here at school you can only =read= files on a shared area *(Open DriveG:)*, but you are *not able* to =edit= them as they are *Read-Only-Access*. /Some folders you won't even be able to see./
- The teacher will have *Read-Write Access* to these file and folders.
- In a =work environment=, the *Accounts staff* will hav *access* to =payroll details=, but other departments will not.
- *The Data Protection Act 1998*, says that =employers= *must keep* /personal data secure/, so setting the appropriate access rights is a legal responsibility as well as a good idea.

** Learn It: Encryption
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
#+BEGIN_SRC
Scrambling data using a key to ensure that it makes no sense to anyone who intercepts it.
When it is received, the recipient also has a key, which is used to decrypt the data,
returning it to its readable format.
#+END_SRC
[[file:img/Encryption.png]]
*Encryption*
- *Encryption* is =primarily= used to *protect data* and *prevent* it from =being hacked= or =accessed illegally=.
- *Data* that is being =transferred= over a network or the Internet is *vulnerable to hackers*. For example, someone who uses an online shopping site will have to type in their *payment details8, such as /credit or debit card numbers/ - It is =essential= that this =information= is =kept secure=.
- If they were paying by using *another payment system* such as, =PayPal= or =ApplePay=, they would have to type in their *email address* and *password*, which needs to be =kept safe= from anyone =intercepting= the transmission.
- *Online Banking* - Accessing your *bank account details online* needs to be =very secure= to protect from hackers trying to *steal this data*.
- Whilst *encryption won't prevent hacking*, it =makes= the =data unreadable= unless the recipient has the necessary decryption tools.
*Encryption Technology uses:*
- *Plaintext* - The original message/data to be encrypted.
- *Ciphertext* - The encrypted message/data.
- *Encryption* - The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext.
- *Decryption* - The process of converting ciphertext into plaintext.
- *Key* - A sequence of numbers used to encrypt or decrypt, often
  using a mathematical formula.
- *Encryption Algorithm* - The method for encrypting the plaintext.

#+END_HTML
A very simple example encryption cipher is =Caesar Shift Cipher=, in which each letter is replaced by a letter /n/ number of positions further in the alphabet. The key in this case is 3.
[[file:img/Caesar_Cipher.png]]
- Obviously this is not a very useful methof of encryption in
  practice, since it is very easy to discover they key and decrypt the
  message. There are many methods of *strong encryption* which make
  the ciphertext virtually impossible to break.

** Learn It: Firewalls
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
#+BEGIN_SRC
These can either be hardware, software or both. A firewall can be instructed to block
certain traffic (Such as all emails or any traffic from a suspect IP address) or to
only allow certain traffic (Such as from a single, trusted device), blocking everything
else.
#+END_SRC
[[file:img/Firewall.png]]
*Firewalls*
- A *firewall* is a =network security system= that *monitors* and *controls* /incoming/ and /outgoing/ network traffic based on *predetermined security rules*.
- A firewall typically =establishes= a *barrier* between a *trusted internal network* and *untrusted external network*, /such as the Internet/.
- A *Firewall is primarily designed to prevent unwanted Internet traffic from gaining access to the LAN.
- =Unauthorised= users external to the network are =blocked= by the firewall, which can also *block any attempts* to gain access via =certain ports= used for restricting data transmission such as =FTP=.
- Typical firewall =mechanisms= for =restricting data= include, *blocking data* from a =particular IP address= or on certain =ports= that indicated a type of traffic that was not wanted, such as an attempt to access FTP.
- *Operating Systems (OS)*, like =Microsoft Windows= and =macOS= have *firewall utilities* built-in, but you can also buy firewall software separately.
- =Third-party firewall= software also exist, such as *Zone Alarm, Norton Personal Firewall, Tiny, Black Ice Protection,* and *McAfee Personal Firewall*. Many of these offer free versions or trials of their commercial versions.
*Several types of firewalls exist:*
- Packet filtering.
- Circuit-level gateway implementation.
- Acting as a proxy server.
- Web application firewall.

** Learn It: MAC Address Filtering
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
#+BEGIN_SRC
Each computer/device has a MAC (Media Access Control) address which, unlike an IP address,
cannot be changed. Based on this unique identifier, specific devices can be either
permitted onto, or blocked from a network.
#+END_SRC
[[file:img/MAC_Filter2.png]]
*MAC Address Filtering*
- MAC address filtering =creates= a list of =allowed devices= which you need on your Wi-Fi and the =list= of =denied devices= which you donâ€™t want on your Wi-Fi. It helps in preventing unwanted access to the network. So, we can *blacklist* or *whitelist* certain computers *based* on their *MAC address*.
- We can also *configure* the filter to *allow connection only* to those devices *included* in the =whitelist=. *White lists* provide =greater security= than =blacklists= because the router grants access only to *selected devices*.
- This has a =weakness= in that on a wireless network the device with the proper =credentials= such as =SSID= and =password= can *authenticate* with the *router* and *join* the network which gets an *IP address* and *access to the internet* and any *shared resources*, but it =does not identify= which =individual= is *using a device*.
- That has to be done using a *username* and *password combination*, *user access levels, encryption* or *using the firewall* to block certain =ports= or =IP addresses=.
- MAC address filtering adds an =extra layer of security= that =checks= the *deviceâ€™s MAC address* against a list of *agreed addresses*. If the *clientâ€™s address* /matches/ one on the routerâ€™s list, *access is granted* otherwise it *doesnâ€™t join the network*.
