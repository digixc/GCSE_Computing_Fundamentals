*Binary Bits*
- Computers are made up of electronic hardware that can store and
  process data.
- A computer can be broken down into basic components which contain
  millions of IC circuits that either do or do not allow electicity to
  flow through them.
- IC circuits are like rows of switches that can either be on or off,
  different combinations can mean different things.
- Each switch can be represented by 1 or 0. This is called *binary*.
- A single *1* or *0* is a *Binary* *digIT*, or a *BIT* for short.
- A *byte* is a group of eight bits.
- A *nibble* is a group of 4 bits or half a byte.

*** Units
- A byte is the smallest addressable unit of memory in a
  computer. Just like a kilometer is a 1000 meters, we can group
  together a 1000 bytes to make a *kilobyte*.
- Memory size is measured in the following multiples:
| *Unit*            | *Number of bytes* |            *Decimal value*           |  *Equivalent to* |
|-------------------+-------------------+--------------------------------------+------------------|
| Kilobyte(KB)      | 10^3              | 1,000                                | 1024 bytes       |
| Megabyte(MB)      | 10^6              | 1,000,000                            | 1024 kilobytes   |
| Gigabyte(GB)      | 10^9              | 1,000,000,000                        | 1024 megabytes   |
| Terabyte(TB)      | 10^12             | 1,000,000,000,000                    | 1024 gigabytes   |
| Petabyte(PB       | 10^15             | 1,000,000,000,000,000                | 1024 terabytes   |
| Exabyte(XB)       | 10^18             | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000            | 1024 petabytes   |
| Zettabyte(ZB)     | 10^21             | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000        | 1024 exabytes    |
| Yotabyte(YB)      | 10^24             | 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000    | 1024 zettabytes  |
*Please Note*
- 1MB = 1000KB etc. Internal memory often use the Kibibyte, where
  1KiB (Kibibyte) = 2^10 = 1,024 bytes, MiB (Mebibyte) = 2^20 =
  1,048,576 bytes, and so on.

- *Platinum*: Complete the Python program below, which is a conversion
  program where you can choose to convert from either KB, MB, GB, TB
  or PB. The user can enter the number of kilobytes and then return the number of bytes for that unit.
