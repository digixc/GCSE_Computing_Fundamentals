#+BEGIN_SRC
Cyber Security â€“ The use of technology, working practices, processes and precautions
designed to protect networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or
unauthorised access.
#+END_SRC
- *Cyber Security* is defined as the =protection of computer systems=, =networks= and =data= from /criminal activity/.
- *Cybercrime* can take =many forms=, including *planting* =viruses=, *acquiring* and *using* =personal= or =confidential data= and =disrupting= a *website or service*.
- *Vulnerability* of a computer network is often due to a =flawed system= which is =open= to =attack=. An =attacker= or =hacker= can then =exploit= this =weakness=.
- *Human error* is one of the =biggest issues= in =security breaches=. For example, in *2010 GCHQ* lost *35* laptops with all the =security data= stored on these devices; there are numerous other cases of where =government officials= have left /USB Memory sticks/ and /other electronic devices/ on *public transport*.

:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/usb_stick.png]]
*Removable Media*
- *Removable media* such as /memory sticks, memory cards/ and /removable hard drives/, can present *two major threats*: =Data Theft= and =Virus Infection=.
- Any storage device that is =highly portable= can easily be =used= to /steal, corrupt, destroy, delete, hack/ or /steal data/ or *introduce* *malware* onto a /computer/network system./
- An example of an issue that could occur when using removable media, is when students has a =copy= of their =school work= on a memory stick which they =take home= to use in their own computer. If their =computer= *does not* have adequate =virus protection= then their memory stick could become =infected=, and if =used at school= could =infect= the /whole school network./

** Try It: Removable Media
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try

- Q1: Suppose that you found an USB Memory stick, what would be the risks of using this unidentified memory stick in your computer?

** Learn It: Weak and Default Passwords
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Weak_Pass.png]]
*Weak and Default Passwords*
- *Password strength* is a *measure* of the =effectiveness= of a password *against guessing* or *brute-force attacks*.
- In its usual form, it *estimates* =how many= tries an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need on average to
  *guess it correctly*. The =strength= of a password is a function of *length*, *complexity*, and *unpredictability*.
- *Using* /strong passwords/ =lowers= overall =risk= of a =security breach=, but strong passwords =do not replace= the *need* for other /effective security controls./
- *Passwords* =should contain= a combination of *upper* and *lower-case* /letters/ as well as /numbers/ and /symbols/. *(E.G. $tROng p@s$worDs).*
- Simarly, *default passwords* can be a problem. For example, a router's new owner might =not change= the *default password* from *admin*
  or *password* when they buy it. The =default password= is usually found in the =instruction manual= or /on the device itself./
- Leaving a =default password= is one of the =major factors= in *compromising* the /security of a system./
 
** Learn It: Misconfigured Access Rights
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Access_Rights.png]]
- *Access Rights* are the =rules= that tell a *computer system* which user should have =access= to which =files= and =other resources=.
- When user accounts have =incorrect permissions=, this can cause big problems as people who are lower down the chain of command could =have access= to *private information* that managers could have. They could =wrongly= have =access= to /employee records/ or /customer data./
- In a school or business, =usernames= are =used= to *identify the access rights* of /each user./
- *Each user* is =assigned= individual =access rights=, *according* to *their role*, and it is important that these should be correctly set.
- For example, most =network users= *should not* have *access* to the =setup= and =configuration=, /as a hacker who gains access to the user's computer could then cause damage./
- *Access rights* can also be =applied= to =indiviual files=. This means that *specific files* /stored/ in an area to which *full access* is normally allowed, can still be given =restrictions= such as being made =read-only=.

** Learn It: Unpatched or Outdated Software
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
*Unpatched or Outdated Software*
[[file:img/Unpatched.png]]
- *Unpatched Software* - When a *security risk* is *identified* in a program, the =developer= will *release* a =patch=, which is an add-on program that =fixes= the =security risk=. If a *user* =does not= *install* the patch, *their computer* is /not secure./
- Based on a sample size of *163 million computers*, =55%= of =all= /programs installed on personal computers running Windows/ are =outdated= according to a recent report, *exposing* their users to *security risks* because of =unpatched vulnerabilities=.
- The top most out-of-date Windows programs installed on PCs around the world shows that in more than =94% of cases=, users who have /installed Adobe Shockwave, VLC Media Player/, and /Skype/ on their computers =haven't updated= them to the *latest versions*.
- *Out-of-date* /Microsoft Office programs/ are another category of applications which put their users at risk, especially given that =15% of all Office installations= are Enterprise 2007, an Office version *Microsoft* has *stopped supporting* since *2017* which means that it =hasn't received= any *bug fixes* or *security patches* for almost =two years=.
- *Threats* will often *exist in combination*. A =username= acquired via =phishing= could be used in *collaboration* with a =weak, easy-to-guess password= to introduce a =virus= that *specifically* seeks out =unpatched software=.
- Other cyber security threats including *Social Engineering* and *Malicious Code* and will be covered in detail with the next topic.

** Learn It: Social Engineering
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Identity_Theft.png]]
*Social Engineering - Summary (/This is covered in detail in 3.6.2 - Social Engineering & Malicious Code/)*
- =People= are often the =weakest point= in *security systems*, *social engineering* focuses on /people/ rather than on *technology*, as the *weak point* in any security system. There are many different ways to =manipulate= people to =surrender= their
  *confidential information* or *data.*
*Social Engineering includes the following techniques:*
 - Blagging.
 - Phishing.
 - Pharming.
 - Shouldering (Shoulder Surfing).

** Learn It: Malicious Code
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Malicious_Code.png]]
*Malicious Code - Summary (/This is covered in detail in 3.6.2 - Social Enginnering & Malicious Code/)*
- Malicious code is the term used to describe any =code= in any part of a =software system= or =script= that is =intended= to =cause= *undesired effects*, *security breaches* or *damage* to a system.
- *Malicious code* is an =application security threat= that *cannot* be efficiently *controlled* by conventional =antivirus software alone=.
#+BEGIN_SRC
Malware - Is a term used to describe a variety of hostile or instrusive programs or
software. Viruses, Spyware, Adware and Trojans are all types of malware, although
there are others.
#+END_SRC
*Malware includes the following:*
 - Viruses.
 - Spyware.

** Learn It: Penetration Testing
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Penetration_Testing.png]]
*What is penetration testing?*
- *Penetration Testing* is used to find any =security weaknesses= in a system. It is the *process* of =attempting= to *gain access* to /resources/ *without* knowledge of /usernames, passwords/ and /other normal means of access./
- *Penetration testing* is also called =pen testing= or =ethical hacking=, is the practice of *testing a computer system, network* or *web application* to find =security vulnerabilities= that a =hacker= could =exploit=.
- *Penetration testing* can be =automated= with software applications or =performed manually=.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- *The strategy is to:*
  - Gather information about the target of possible attacks.
  - Identify possible entry points.
  - Attempt to break in.
  - Report back the findings.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
*Black-box Penetration Test*
- The =aim= of =black-box pentration testing= is to =simulate= an *external hacking* or *cyber warfare attack.*
- *Testers* are =given very little= or =no information= about the *network* prior to the test. The *test* could target /email servers, web servers/ or /firewalls./
- *The objective is to find out:*
  - Whether a hacker can get in.
  - How far they can get.
  - What they can do on the system.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
*White-box Penetration Test*
- The =aim of white-box penetration testing= is to =simulate= a =malicious insider= who has *knowledge of* and possibly *basic credentials* for the =target system=.
- *Testers* are given =basic information= about the network in advance of the testing. This could include /IP addresses, network protocols/ and /even passwords./
- It puts the tester in the =position= of =an insider=, to *determine* how *much damage* a /disgruntled/ or /dishonest employee could cause./
