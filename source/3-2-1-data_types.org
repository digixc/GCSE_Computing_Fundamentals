* What are Data Types?

#+BEGIN_SRC
Data can consist of numbers, characters, symbols, logical data or images. Data can be
stored in many different forms called 'Data Types'. These forms determine what actions
can be performed on the data when it is assigned to a variable in programming, or a
field in a Database or Spreadsheet.
#+END_SRC
- *All data*, whether they be /numbers, text, symbols, logical, images or video/ are *stored* as a series of *binary digits*, =1s= and =0s= which the computer needs to know how to =interpret=.
- In a computer program, a variable is used to hold data that can be used or manipulated in certain ways depending on the type of data it is assigned.
- Computers *need* to be *told* /what type of data it is/, so they know how it can be =manipulated= and =represented=.
- *For Example:*
  - A student creates a variable called =FirstName= to hold the letters of a person's first name and they declare this variable's data type as =String=. The *computer* will *interpret* the 1's and 0's as =letters=. It will not try to use this variable in a mathematical equation because you =cannot multiply text=.
  - Similarly, a variable called =length= is declared as =Integer= data type, and can be multiplied by another variable like =width= to give the area of a shape.
[[file:img/Data_Type_Code.png]]
- In some programming languages, like =Python=, *variable data types* =do not need declaring= at all. The *program* will *assume* the =data type= of a
  variable *based* on what is =put in it=. For example; if you write *a = 21, b = "George"* - *a* will be stored as an =integer= /(whole number)/ and
  *b* will be stored as a =string= /(text)/.
- Although you *do not* have to *declare* =variable data types=, you still need to *understand* the /different data types/ and how to work with them in the programs your write.

* Data Types In Programming

- *The table below details some of the main data types you will use:*
[[file:img/Data_Type_Table.png]] 
*The five main data types you will need to understand and use are:*
  - Integer.
  - Real (Float).
  - Character.
  - String.
  - Boolean.
#+BEGIN_SRC
Integer - Is a whole number which can be either positive (0 or above) or negative
(under 0). Lets look at how this can be used in pseudocode and Python.
#+END_SRC
[[file:img/Integer_Table.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC
Real - Is any number (positive or negative) including decimal places.
In Python areal number is called a floating-point number or float for short.
#+END_SRC
[[file:img/Real_Table.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC
Character - Is a single symbol such as a letter. Take the word “hello” this
could be defined as 5 single characters “h”, ”e”, “l”, “l”, and “o”.
#+END_SRC
[[file:img/Char_Table.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC
String - Is a series of characters that are combined to make a single piece of data.
They are defined by adding speech marks around the value. However, in Python anything
that the user inputs is treated as a string text unless otherwise specified.

- Q1: In the example code above why is the data type not defined? Will this code work and why?

#+BEGIN_SRC
Boolean - Boolean values can have one of two values, usually True or False and cannot be left empty.
#+END_SRC
[[file:img/Boolean_Table2.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC
Casting - Casting is when you convert a variable value from one type to another. This is,
in Python, done with functions such as int() or float() or str().
