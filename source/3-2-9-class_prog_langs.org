** Learn It: What are the different levels of Programming Languages?

#+BEGIN_SRC
A programming language - Is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions
that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer
programming to implement specific algorithms. Most programming languages consist
of instructions for computers.
#+END_SRC 
#+BEGIN_SRC
A computer program - Is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task
when executed by a computer. Most computer devices require programs to function
properly. A computer program is usually written by a computer programmer and can be
can be written in either high or low-level languages, depending on the task and the
hardware being used.
#+END_SRC 
- When we think about computer programmers, we probably think about people who write in =high-level language=.
- *Most computer programming languages* are =written= in a =high-level programming language=. They =use= the *common English language* to help make the code more =understandable= and to =speed up= the *process* of /writing/ and /debugging programs/.
- *Computers*, however, =use= their =own language= written using =binary= called =Machine code=. This is =known= as a =low-level language=.

*Programming languages can be divided into two different levels:*
  - *Low-level Languages* – Hardware/Processor-specific assembly languages and machine code.
  - *High-level Languages* – Python, Visual Basic, Java, C, C++, SQL and many more.

*Differences between Low-level and High-level Languages:*

** Learn It: Program Translators
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
*Program Translators:*
- *High-level languages* and *assembler languages* =need= to be =translated= into =machine code= for a =computer= system to =understand it=.
*There are three types of translator programs that will do this:*
- *Interpreters*
  - Once the program has been created, it needs to be saved before it can be run.
  - *At this point* the *programming language* =translates= the =source code= into =machine code= /one command/line at a time/ and =immediately= /executes them/.
  - *You must have* the =interpreter installed= on your computer =in order= to =run= the =software=.
  - *Every time the program runs*, it =has= to be =translated again= as there is no secondary file that is created to store the machine code and therefore must be translated each time the program is run.
  - *A long, complex program* will take a considerably =more time= to =execute= /if it is being interpreted/.
  - *This makes interpreted code* =slower= to run *than* =compiled code=, but it =shows any errors= /as soon as it finds them/, so it is =easier to debug= *than* =compiled code=. /Python, Basic, JavaScript/ and /Pascal/ are *all* =interpreter-based programming languages=.
- *Compilers:*
  - *A compiler* =translates= *all* the =source code= *at the same time* to *create* the =compiled code=, or =machine code=, *also known as* the =object code=.
  - *The machine code* is *saved* and *stored* in a =separate file= to the *high-level programming language*.
  - Once the programmer has =created the program=, they need to *request it* to be =compiled= *before* they can =run= and =test= the file which can =take a while=.
  - This can =make testing= *small sections* of the program =slower= as the *whole program* =needs= to be =compiled= *before* any of /it can be run/.
  - *Compiling can take a long time*, but =once complete= the compiled =code runs quickly= and =reports= a list of =errors=, if any have occurred.
  - *Overall*, once the program has =finished compiling=, =compiled programs= are =faster to run=. *Java* and *C++* are /compiler programming languages/.
  - *For the developer*, =compiled code= has the =advantage= that the *user of the software* =cannot see= the =source code= or =copy it=.
[[file:img/Compiler_Image.png]]
- *Assemblers:*
  - *An assembler* =translates= *assembly language* into =machine code= and is *effectively a compiler* for the =assembly language=, but can also be *used* /interactively/ like an =interpreter=.
  - *Assembly language* uses words called =‘mnemonics’=, such as =LOAD, STORE= and =ADD=. The *instructions* are =specific= to the =hardware= being =programmed= because =different CPUs= *use* /different programming languages/.
  - *Finally*, every =assembly language instruction= is =translated= into *a single* =machine code= *instruction*.
