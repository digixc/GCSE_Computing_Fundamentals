- When =two= or =more= *computers/devices* are connected together
  through a =communication medium=, allowing them to =exchange data=, =share resources= and =communicate=, we have a *computer network*.
- Often a computer network conforms to the =server= / =client= model.
- *Examples of networks could include:*
  - Mobile Phones/Devices using Bluetooth (PAN).
  - Bourne Grammar School using wired or wireless (LAN).
  - The Internet (WAN).
#+BEGIN_HTML

#+END_HTML
- The largest and most famous =Wide Area Network (WAN)= in the World is the Internet. This is a collection of
    inter-connected networks *(LANs)*.
- The Internet is a =Worldwide collection= of =computers/devices= and
  =networks=, not owned or managed by any one group of people. Anyone
  can access the Internet using either wired or wireless connections.
- The World Wide Web (WWW) - Is a =collection of html documents= and
  =web pages= that are all linked to each other using =hyperlinks=. *Sir Tim Berners-Lee* invented the WWW in 1989.
- *Websites* are stored on =web servers= connected to the Internet,
  and each website has a =unique web address= (/IP Address/), so that
  it can be accessed. All information on the WWW is stored as =HTML
  documents= known as =web pages=.
- *Web Pages* can be accessed using a program called a =Web Browser= such as /Google Chrome, Firefox/ or /Safari/.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- *Let's define some of those terms:*
  - =Communication Media= refers to the connection between computers. This could be standard copper cable (/normally Cat5e or 6/), /Fibre Optic cable/ or /Wireless Radio/.
  - =Resources= are devices such as /printers/ or /storage devices/, that computers on the network have shared access to.
  - =Servers= are just another computer. They may sometimes be very high-powered if the service they are providing is computationally hard (such as serving millions of web-pages or performing advanced modelling) or they can be tiny devices such as a Raspberry Pi (/serving media over a home network/).
  - =Clients= are computers that *use* the services provided by the server.

** Learn It: What are the main types of Networks?
:PROPERTIES:

- Computer networks allows computers and devices to be connected together to share data. This includes:
  - Computer to computer communications.
  - Computers communicating with devices such as printers, a mouse and
    a keyboard.
  - Mobile phone networks.
  - Smart Devices (/Televisions, Digital Assistants, Fridges, iKettles, iToasters, wearable tech, Smart Home Devices etc../)
  - Tablets amd media players downloading/streaming videos and music and playing them through external devices such as speakers and digital projectors.

In order to connect to a network, a computer device needs some hardware and also software that allows it to communicate with each other.
- =A Network Interface Card (NIC)= is a component that *connects a device to a network*. It formats the data sent into the required format according to the *protocols (rules)* of the network. NICs can exist for both *wired* and *wireless* connections.
[[file:img/NIC_Card.png]]
- =Switch= – Switches *connect devices on a LAN*. Switches receive data (*in units called frames*) from one device and transmit this data to the device on the network with the correct *MAC address*. They *build* up a *table* of *MAC addresses* on the
  network.
[[file:img/Switch.png]]
- =Routers= – Are responsible for transmitting data *between networks* – They’re always connected to at least two different networks. Routers have a crucial role on the Internet, directing data (*in units called packets*) to their destination. They are used in *homes and offices* to connect the *LAN* to the *Internet*.
[[file:img/Router.png]]
- =MAC Address (Media Access Control)= – Every device needs a *unique identifier* so that it can be found on a network  that allow data to
  be sent to the correct component. They are unique to the device and *cannot be changed*. MAC addresses are *48 bits* in length and are usually displayed as a *12-digit hexadecimal number*.

* Transmission Media

** Learn It: What Networks use to communicate?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
In order for a network to communicate, it requires a form of transmission media. The two ways that network devices communicate over
a network are either by =cable= or =radio waves= (/Wired or
Wireless/).
- =Ethernet Cables= – The most common Ethernet cables are *CAT5e* and
  *CAT6*, they containing *four pairs* of *copper wires* that are *twisted* together to reduce internal *interference*. *Data* is sent
  as *electrical currents*.
 [[file:img/Ethernet.png]]
- =Fibre Optic Cables= - Uses *glass* (/or plastic/) threads
  (/fibres/) to transmit data. A fibre optic cable consists of a bundle of glass threads, each of which is capable of transmitting
  messages modulated onto *light waves*. Pulses of light are generated by a =light emitting diode (LED)= or *a laser*.
[[file:img/Fibre.png]]
- =Wireless (Wi-Fi) Wireless Fidelity= – Like mobile phones and TVs, wireless networks use *radio waves* to *transmit data*. Microwaves are a type of
  radiowave that consist of *electromagnetic radiation* travelling in waves with a *frequency higher* that *1 gigahertz* (/1GHz to 300GHz
  per second/). Data is transmitted across the network in
  *frequency bands* of between *2.4* and *5GHz*.
- The bands are *split* into *numbered* /channels/ that each cover a small
  frequency range. They also use different *Wi-Fi spectrums* for example; /802.11b, 802.11g/ and /802.11n/.

- As we have previously learned, connections between computers on a network can either be *wired* or *wireless*.
- In a wired network, computers are connected through wires or cables,
  whereas in a wireless network, radio waves are used to transmit data, so no cables are needed.
- Mobile phones and televisions also use radio waves to transmit data.
- Wi-Fi is the standard used in wireless networks.
