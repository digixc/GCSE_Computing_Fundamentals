:END:
- We have briefly covered what social engineering is in the previous topic, but we will look at this in more detail. Essentially it is the *art* of =manipulating people= so that they *give up* =confidential information=.
- =People= are often the =weakest point= in *security systems*, *social engineering* focuses on /people/ rather than on *technology*, as the *weak point* in any security system. There are many different ways to =manipulate= people to =surrender= their *confidential information* or *data.*
- There are =many threats= to =network security=. *Most target* the /computers/ and /communications software/, but *many target* far *weaker links*: the =people= who use them.
- A *study* in *2015* found that =human error= was the *main root cause* of =over 52%= of all *security breaches* to networks.
- The =biggest problems= were *failure* to =follow general= /policies/ and /procedures/, /general carelessness/ and a /lack of knowledge of threats/.
- *Some of the methods used* to =breach= network security =need no= *knowledge of programming* or *computers*.
- These are =low-tech= *con-tricks*, referred to as =social engineering=, aimed at =manipulating= *vulnerable people* into =disclosing= their *personal information*.
#+BEGIN_HTML

*Social Engineering includes the following techniques:*
 - Blagging (Pretexting).
 - Phishing.
 - Pharming.
 - Shouldering (Shoulder Surfing).
** Learn It: Blagging
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Blagging.png]]
*Blagging or Pretexting*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Blagging - Is the act of creating and using an invented scenario to engage a targeted
victim in a manner that increases the chance that the victim will divulge information
or perform actions that would be unlikely in ordinary circumstances.
#+END_SRC
- *Blagging:* This is sometimes called =pretexting= and *can be* done =face-to-face=, by =telephone= or by =computer=.
- The *criminal* =invents a scenario= to try to get the *victim* to *divulge* =sensitive data= or =information=, for example *pretending* to be a /charity/ or an /official/ such as a /police officer/, /bank employee/ or an /insurance claims investigator/.
- To help =prevent blagging=, the company or organisation *should make sure* that they =provide= *security training* to their staff, so that they *don't fall for these tricks*.

[[file:img/Phishing.png]]
*Phishing*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Phishing - Is a technique of fraudulently obtaining private information, often
using email or SMS.
#+END_SRC
- The term *Phishing* comes from *fishing* - =Bait= is *spread across* the =Internet= in the hope that *people* will take a =bite=.
- *Phishing:* Is when *criminals* /send/ =emails= or =texts= to *people claiming* to be from a =well-known business=, /(e.g. a bank or online retailer)/.
- The *emails* often contain *links* to =spoof versions= of the *company’s website*. They *request* that the *user update* their =personal information= /(e.g. password or bank account details)/. *When* the *user inputs* this *data* into the *website* they =hand it= all over to the =criminals=, /who can then access their genuine account./
- You *should* always *beware* of =links= in *emails* or *texts*. The *email* is *not* usually addressed to you =personally= and *often* contains =spelling= and =grammar mistakes=.
- *Sometimes* emails may *contain* a =threat= that *something bad* is going to happen /if you don't click on the link/, for example, *your account* will be *closed down* in two days' time.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
*Phishing emails can often be recognised by the following:*
 - *Urgency* - They want you to *respond quickly*, without thinking, for example to supply your bank details before the account is suspended.
 - *Careless use of language* - They often contain *spelling and grammatical errors* and *careless writing style*.
 - *Impersonality* - You *may not* be =addressed personally=, but only as *Dear Customer*. However, as the =criminals= become more =sophisticated= they are able to *find your personal details* from =various sources= such as =social media=.
 - *False Links* - You may be asked to =click= on a =link= which *leads* to a *website controlled* by the =criminals=.
 - *Attachments* - Sometimes you may be *asked* to *open* =programs= or =documents= sent with the email; these =attachments= may *contain* =malware=.
*Below is an example of a Phishing Email*

** Learn It: Pharming
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Pharming.png]]
*Pharming*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Pharming - Is a cyber attack technique intended to redirect a website's traffic to an
unsafe or fake website.
#+END_SRC
- Pharming =redirects= *web traffic* to =fake sites=. The =attacker= will *place code* on your =hard drive= or on the =network server= itself.
- *When* you *type* in a =genuine website address=, *pharming redirects* you to a =fake/bogus website= and you may be =asked= to give =personal= or
  =sensitive information=.
- *Pharming works* by =changing= the =hosts file= on the *victim's computer* by *exploiting* a vulnerability in the =Domain Name Service (DNS)= /server software/.
- The =DNS servers= are *responsible* for *translating* /Internet names/ into their /real IP addresses/.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
*To prevent Pharming users should:*
 - *Check* that the *HTTP address* of the site is the one you *intended* to visit.
 - Check that there is a *secure connection (HTTPS)* if you have to enter *sensitive information*.
 - Check the site's *security certificates*.
 - Install the latest *security patches*.
 - Install *Antivirus Software*.

[[file:img/Shouldering.png]]
*Shouldering*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Shouldering - Is observing a person's private information over the shoulder.
e.g. Cashpoint machine PIN number.
#+END_SRC
- *Most security risks* are usually =remote theft=, but there are other ways to gain unauthorised access to passwords or sensitive information.
- *Shouldering* or *Shoulder Surfing* refers to using =direct observation techniques= to *gain* information such as =passwords= or =security data=.
- For example, *looking over someone's shoulder* while they are =typing= in their =ATM PIN= number or =computer password=.
- *To prevent* =shoulder surfing= you should *shield* the *keypad* from view by using your body or /cupping your hand over the keypad/. When working on a =laptop= or =mobile tablet device=, keep your back to a wall with no open sides and =extra care= should be taken when =entering= a =password=. 
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
*Shouldering can occur in the following ways:*
 - Someone in an office watching others entering passwords.
 - Someone watching as they enter their PIN at a cashpoint machine (ATM).
 - An employee at a shop or petrol station watching as a PIN is being entered.
 - Criminals using binoculars or closed circuit television to watch from a distance or record users entering sensitive information.

[[file:img/Malicious_Code.png]]
- We have briefly covered what *malicious code* is in the *previous topic*, but we will look at this in more detail. Essentially *MALicious softWARE* (Mal WARE) is *installed* on =someone’s device= *without* their =knowledge= or =consent=.
- *Security* is about =keeping= your =computer= and the =files=, =programs= and =data= *stored* on it =safe= from a =number of hazzards=.
- These =hazzards= come in the form of /malware, hackers, blagging, phishing, pharming, hardware/ and /software faults/.
- Other =people= using the network can also be *one* of the =greatest risks of all=.
- Malicious code is the term used to describe any =code= in any part of a =software system= or =script= that is =intended= to =cause= *undesired effects*, *security breaches* or *damage* to a system.
- *Malicious code* is an =application security threat= that *cannot* be efficiently *controlled* by conventional =antivirus software alone=.
*Malware*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Malware - Is a term used to describe a variety of hostile or instrusive programs or
software. Viruses, Worms, Trojans (Trojan Horse), Spyware and Adware and are all
types of malware, although there are others.
#+END_SRC
*Malware Software is designed to:*
 - Disrupt the functioning of a computer system.
 - Gain unauthorised access to a computer system.
 - Gather other information from the users without their knowledge.
#+BEGIN_HTML

#+END_HTML
*Types of Malware include the following:*
 - Computer Virus.
 - Worms.
 - Trojans (Trojan Horse).
 - Spyware.

[[file:img/Viruses.png]]
*Viruses*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Computer Viruses - Are self-replicating pieces of code that can damage data or software.
They are often spread via email attachments or removable media such as USB memory sticks.
#+END_SRC
- A *virus* is a *program* that is *installed* on a *computer* =without your knowledge= or =permission= with the =purpose= of *doing harm*.
- They =attach= themselves *(by copying themselves)* to =certain files=, /e.g. .exe files and autorun scripts/.
- Users =spread= them by =copying infected files= & =activate= them by *opening infected files*.
- *Viruses* are often =spread= through =email attachments= or =instant messaging services=. you may be *invited* to *open* /a funny image, greeting card, audio or video files/.
- They may also be =spread= through =files, programs= or =games= that you =download= from the =Internet= or by =loading= an =infected file= from a *memory stick or a CD/DVD*.
- *Some virues* are just =annoying= and =don't do any damage=, but others will =delete= or =change system files= so that they become =corrupted= or the =computer becomes unusable=.
- *Some viruses* =fill up the hard disk=, so that your *computer* =runs very slowly= or becomes =unresponsive=.

** Learn It: Worms
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Worms.png]]
*Worms*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Worms - A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself
in order to spread to other computers.
#+END_SRC
- *Worms* are like viruses, but they =self-replicate= *without any user help*, meaning they can =spread very quickly=.
- They =exploit weaknesses= in *network security*.
- Often, it *uses* a =computer network= to =spread itself=, *relying* on *security failures* on the target computer to access it.
- *Worms* almost always cause at least =some harm= to the =network=, even if only by =consuming bandwidth=, /whereas viruses almost always corrupt/ or /modify files on a targeted computer/.
- *Many worms* are designed =only to spread=, and =do not= attempt to =change the systems= they pass through.
- However, as the =Morris worm= and =Mydoom= showed, even these "payload-free" worms can =cause major disruption= by *increasing network traffic* and other unintended effects.
- The *motives* for trojans may *vary*, for example, some may give =unauthorised access= to that computer, some may =crash the computer=, =spread malware= across the network, =corrupt data=, =reformat disks= or =access sensitive information=.

** Learn It: Trojans (Trojan Horse)
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Trojans.png]]
*Trojans*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Trojans - Are legitimate programs developed with the intention of hiding malicious code
within. Since they are largely legitimate, they are often not recognised as malware.
#+END_SRC
- *Trojan horse* is named after the famous Ancient Greek story of the
  Trojan Horse, is a program that =disguised itself= as *legitimate
  software*.
- *Unlike viruses & worms*, trojans =don’t replicate themselves=,
  *users* =install them= not realising they have a =hidden purpose=.
- Trojans can be employed by =cyber-thieves= and =hackers= trying to
  *gain access* to users' systems.
- Users are typically =tricked= by some form of =social engineering=
  into *loading* and *executing* trojans on their systems.

** Learn It: Spyware
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Spyware.png]]
*Spyware*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Spyware - Covertly obtains sensitive data, such as credit card numbers and passwords,
transmitting the data to a hacker across the Internet.
#+END_SRC
- *Spyware* is software that =gathers information= about a =person= or =organisation= *without their knowledge*.
- It is often =used= to =track= and =store= *users' movements* on the =Internet= through the use of =tracking cookies=.
- *Some spyware* may =change= /computer settings, making unauthorised changes/ in /web browser settings/ or /changes to software settings/.
- *Spyware* can also be used to =collect personal information= such as /logins/ or /bank account details/.
- The use of the term *spyware* has declined more recently, as the practice of tracking users' visits to different websites is used by many major websites and data mining companies and is not illegal.

** Learn It: Adware
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
[[file:img/Adware.png]]
*Adware*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Adware - Downloads unwanted Internet adverts, often observing your online behaviour
in order to target specific adverts.
#+END_SRC
- *Adware* =analyses= which =Internet sites= a *user visits* and then =presents adverts= for *products* which the *user* is *likely* to be =interested in=.
- *Adware, or advertising-supported software*, is software that =generates revenue= for its developer by *automatically* generating =online advertisements= in the user interface of the software or on a screen presented to the user during the installation process.
- The software may *generate two types* of revenue: =one is for the display of the advertisement= and another on a =pay-per-click= basis, if the user clicks on the advertisement.
- The *software* may *implement advertisements* in a =variety of ways=, including a *static box display*, a *banner display*, *full screen*, *a video*, *pop-up advert* in some other form.
- *Adware* is also *sometimes* =described as malware= and *anti-adware software is available*.
- Although *most adware* operates =legally= and some adware manufacturers have even sued antivirus companies for blocking adware.

[[file:img/Ransomware.png]]
*Ransomware*
- *Ransomware* is a type of =malware= from =cryptovirology= that *threatens* to *publish* the victim's *data* or *block* access to it *unless* a =ransom is paid=.
- While some *simple ransomware* may =lock= the system in a way which is *not difficult* for a knowledgeable person to *reverse*, more =advanced malware= uses a =technique= called =cryptoviral extortion=, in which it =encrypts= the *victim's files*, making them =inaccessible=, and =demands a ransom payment= to *decrypt them*.
- *Ransomware attacks* are *typically* carried out using a =Trojan= that is =disguised= as a =legitimate file= that the user is *tricked* into *downloading* or *opening* as an *email attachment*.
[[file:img/Rootkit.png]]
*Rootkits*
- A rootkit is a *collection of computer software*, typically =malicious=, designed to =enable access= to a *computer* or an *area of its software* that is not otherwise allowed and =often masks= its *existence* or the *existence of other software*.
- *The term rootkit* is a concatenation of =root= and the word =kit=.
- *Rootkits* /allows/ an =unauthorised user= to gain *full control* over a *computer*, including the *host operating system*, to =avoid detection=.
