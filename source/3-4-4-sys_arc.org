- *Computer architecture* refers to the /functionality/, /organisation/,
  /structure/ and /implementation/ of a *computer system*.
- The processor known as the =Central Processing Unit= *(CPU)* is the
  brains of the computer. It is here where data processing takes place. 
- The =first computer systems= developed were =not able= to =store= programs
  and program =data= was =inputted= using =switches=.
- In *1945* =John Von Neumann= was credited with designing the fundamental concept
  behind all modern computer systems.
- =Von Neumann Architecture= describes a system where a single
  *control unit* manages the =Fetch-Execute cycle=, and both *instructions* and *data*
  are *stored* in the same *memory unit*.
- His design included a *processing unit*, a *program counter*, *memory* to
  *store data* and *instructions* and *external storage* and *input*
  and *output* mechanisms.
- In the *Von Neumann* architecture:
  - The *program* is *stored* in the *main memory* and *instructions* are *fetched* and *executed sequentially*.
  - There is a *single memory* and *bus system* for accessing both *data* and *programs*.

- The diagram above shows the components of the central processing unit *(CPU)* and how they communicate with each other and with the
  other computer system components.
- Take a close look at the components, their functions and the way in which program instructions are executed will be
  described later in this topic.

- The CPU lies at the heart of any Computer System, and is analogous
  to the brain in a human. There are many processors in a modern
  computer. CPUs can contain one or more processing units known as
  cores.
- It is common for computers to have =two (dual)=, =four (quad)= or even more cores. *CPUs* with =multiple cores= have =more power= to run =multiple programs= at the =same time=.
- A CPU is an integrated circuit that is responsible for =performing arithmetic=, =logical= and =I/O operations=.
- CPUs perform these operations as instructed by a computer program.

- *A CPU is made up of three components:*
  - An Arithmetic & Logic Unit *(ALU)*.
  - A Control Unit *(CU)*.
  - Registers *(Cache)*.

- When the program is loaded, the processor is given a start address of where the program is =stored= in the =main memory= in order to
  access it.
- To run the program, the processor =fetches= an instruction, =decodes
  it= and then =executes it=.
- The program executes =one instruction at a time= and this is known
  as the =Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle=.

- In many machines, the Graphics card is a separate device that is plugged into the Motherboard, but in laptops and mobile devices, it
  is often integrated with the Motherboard and so can't be upgraded.

:PROPERTIES:

#+BEGIN_SRC
Memory refers to the part of a computer system that stores data for use by the central
processing unit (CPU). The data includes program files and data files used by programs.
The main memory components are situated on computer chips, known as semi-conductors.
A semi-conductor is a material that can conduct electricity under certain conditions,
but not in others, making it useful for controlling electrical current.
#+END_SRC
[[file:img/memory_pyramid.gif]]
- There are different types of memory that a computer system uses, they can be classified as =volatile=, =Non-volatile= and =Virtual Memory=. Details
  of each are shown below:
[[file:img/types_ram.png]]
** Learn It: Random Access Memory (RAM)
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
*** Random Access Memory (RAM)
- *RAM* is used to hold programs currently being executed, and the data the programs are using.
- When a =program= is to be =executed=, it has to be =loaded= from the =hard disk= into the =main memory=, so that the processor can access the
  instructions.
- Any data needed for that program to run is also loaded into main memory. The /processor cannot access secondary storage directly/.
- The =main purpose of RAM= is to act as a =temporary storage= for
  programs and data, while the program is being executed.
#+BEGIN_HTML
<br>
#+END_HTML
- *There are two types of RAM:*
  - *Static RAM (SRAM)*: Can hold data without being refreshed for as
    long as there is a power supply. More expensive than DRAM.
  - *Dynamic RAM (DRAM)*: Needs to be refreshed by frequently reading
    and rewriting the contents because its stored charge does not last
    very long. DRAM is more widely used because it is cheaper and
    takes up less space than SRAM.
[[file:img/ram_sticks.jpg]]
*Benefits of having more RAM*
- Having more RAM can mean a =Faster= or =Smoother= System for the
  following reasons:
  - Computers with =less RAM= may =run slowly= due to having to make use
    of =Virtual Memory=.
  - Computers with =more RAM= can run more applications or more
    =memory-intensive= applications making the system =run faster
    overall=.
  - =Upgrading RAM= is relatively cheap and easy to do, replacing RAM
    with a higher capacity or higher speed, will improve the system
    performance.
** Learn It: Read Only Memory (ROM)
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
*** Read Only Memory (ROM)
- *ROM* is a type of =non-volatile memory= that =stores= essential data
  such as a =computer's configuration settings=.
- Essential data is pre-installed onto ROM chips when a computer
  system is made. This type of memory is necessary to enable a
  computer to =optain instructions= and =information= about the =hardware=
  from the moment it is switched on.
- Once a file has been stored on a *ROM*, it can be read but =cannot= be
  =changed= by the user.
- ROM can be accessed even if your computer has been switched off for months.

* Secondary Storage
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
** Learn It: What is Secondary Storage?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *Secondary storage* is a means of *permanently* storing *large amounts of data* and programs that are not currently running on the
  CPU or being stored in the main memory.
- It is a *non-volatile* form of storage, meaning that data is retained even when the power supply is turned off, so it needs to
  robust and reliable.
- Secondary storage holds much more data than main memory and is much cheaper per MB than main memory, although secondary storage
  technologies tend to have slower access speeds than main memory.
- Secondary storage can be internal - such as a computer hard drive, Optical drive or external - such as a /Solid-State Drive (SSD), a USB Flash Drive or a Memory Card/.
- Internal storage is used to store a computer's operating system, software and user files.
- External storage is used for backing up data, transferring files, transporting files or as an extension to internal storage.
** Learn It: Secondary Storage Size
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn

- There are *three classes of secondary storage* - /Magnetic, Optical/ and /Solid-State/.
- Secondary storage sizes are measured in bytes.
