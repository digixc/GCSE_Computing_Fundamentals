** Learn It: What is validation?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
#+BEGIN_SRC
Validation – Is when a program checks if the data being entered into the computer/device is
reasonable, sensible and suitable. This a called data validation. For example, checking
that a person’s DOB is not in the future or that the string is not empty. Validation does
not ensure that data is correct.
#+END_SRC 
- *Most commercial programs* or *web applications* require =some form= of =user input= to =ensure= that the =program= *will not crash* or do *something unexpectedly* if a user enters something incorrectly.
- Therefore, =all data= *must be checked* as soon as it is =inputted=.
- *Validation* can =only check= *if a data input item* is =reasonable=, it =cannot= check if =it's correct=.
- If a web application *asks* the user for their =date of birth=, that *application* can *check* that the *data entered* would be =appropriate= for
  a particular age group. (/i.e. Over 18/), but it =cannot check= if you *entered* =December= instead of =January= by =mistake=.
- Although *validation can help ensure* that any =data entered= is =sensible=, *verification* /double checks/ that the *data* has been *entered correctly*. /This is an important difference/.
- *Data* is usually =entered twice= and the =two versions= are =compared=. If *they are different*, then the =user= is =prompted= to =try again=.
- This is *commonly* used with =username/email= and =passwords= that are entered on applications.
*There are several different types of validation checks that can be used:*
  1. *Range Check* – A number or date should be within a sensible or allowed or specific range.
  2. *Type Check* – Ensures that the correct data type has been entered such as, an integer, float, string or Boolean.
  3. *Length Check* – Ensures that a string contains a valid number of characters that is not too short or long, for example, a password is greater than 8 characters or a National Insurance Number is no longer than 9 characters.
  4. *Presence Check* – This checks that the user input is not left blank/empty. This is essentially a length check that ensures that the length is greater than zero.
  5. *Format Check* – Checks the format of the input, for example, a postcode or email address is appropriate.
*Range Check Example:*
- The following algorithm asks the user to enter an integer between 5 and 10, which is validated by using a while loop that performs a range check. The number is then multiplied by 2 and outputted.
[[file:img/Range_Check.png]]
*Type Check Example:*
- The following algorithm asks the user to something, and performs a type check to identify whether it is a string, integer or a float number.
[[file:img/Type_Check.png]]
*Length Check Example:*
- The following algorithm asks the user to enter their name, and performs a length check. The name must be between 2 and 20 characters.
[[file:img/Length_Check.png]]
*Presence Check Example:*
- The following algorithm asks the user to enter a sentence which uses the .lower() method to return the lowercased string from the given string and performs a presence check.
[[file:img/Presence_Check.png]]
*Format Check Example:*
- The following algorithm asks the user to enter their nine-digit National Insurance Number, and performs a format check using string formatting. The number must be 9 characters long and in the format of: LLNNNNNNL.

** Learn It: Validation through Menus
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
*Creating menus*
- One easy way to =control= what a =user enters= into a system is to use =menu commands= and =options= that you want to display for users.
- They can then =enter= a =letter= or a =number= to *select* the *option* they want.
- This is =another way= of =validating data= through a =menu= and set =options= to choose from, you can use =if statements= to give the =correct response=, /depending on how the user answers/.
- *Below* is an =example menu algorithm= that *uses letters* for the =options= and whatever *letter is typed in* is =converted= to =lowercase= before the if statement starts.

*** Silver - Validating Input (5 Marks)
1. Create a Python program that will ask the user to input two numbers between 1 and 100.
2. Use a subroutine to find out if the data is valid or not. After valid numbers have been inputted the program should show them a menu giving them the option to either add or multiply the numbers together and keep asking for their menu selection until they enter a valid option.
3. Use subroutines to perform the correct calculation and display the final answer in a user-friendly format (i.e. display a message such as “The answer is...”)

** Learn It: Try and Except
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
*Try and Except*
- *Sometimes* the =user= can make a =mistake= and =crash the program= which can be very frustrating.
- *Instead* of *letting the program* =crash=, it is much more =user friendly= to *show them an error message* /so they can try again/.
- This is where the =“Try and Except”= can help. It *works in a similar way* to an =if statement=, but *instead* of =crashing the program= it will =run= the =catch= (/or except/) block.

** Learn It: Creating Simple Authentication Routines
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
#+BEGIN_SRC
Authentication – This is the process of recognising a user’s identity. It is the mechanism
of associating an incoming request with a set of identifying credentials. The credentials
provided are compared to those on a file in a database of the authorised user’s information
on a local operating system or within an authentication server. The software process of
ensuring that the person accessing a system is the person who is supposed to access that
system. 
#+END_SRC 
- Often a *computer system* will =require= a =user= to =login= to *ensure* that they are =authorised= to *use the system*.
*The following authentication methods might be used:*
  1. User ID and passwords.
  2. Memorable Information – Prompting the user for something only the real user should know, such as a favourite place or the name of their first pet.
  3. Checking that the user is using their usual computer, by logging their IP address.
  4. Biometric Methods such as, optical, facial or fingerprint recognition.
- *Authentication techniques* are used throughout the *Cyber Security world*.
- A *simple identification routine* is used when you *log into the school network*, or an *online shopping site*.
- Usually you’ll be *assigned* a =user ID= and you choose a =password= when you *first login*.
- The *password* is =encrypted= and =saved= in a =file=.
- When you enter your =user ID= and =encrypted password= it is =compared= to the =one stored= for *that* /user ID/.
*Example Verification login:*
[[file:img/Verification_ID.png]]
- *User ID verification* is =used= when a =new user= is *logging* on to a *website* for the =first time=, they are *prompted* to =choose a password=, and then have to =re-enter= it to =verify= that they have =typed it= in =correctly=.
*The following algorithm demonstrates a simple verification process:*

*** Gold - User Authentication (8 Marks)
1. Create a simple authentication routine that uses a username and password.
2. The username and password does not require encrypting and can be in plain text.
3. The username must have at least 4 characters and the password must have at least 8 characters.
4. Users should only be given 3 attempts to login, before being given a ‘locked out’ message and the program should terminate.
5. A welcome message should be given for successful logins.

** Learn It: Testing your Programs
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
#+BEGIN_SRC
Testing – When developing a program, tests should be performed throughout the process
to ensure that the program functions correctly, is error free and meets the
specification requirements.
#+END_SRC 
- How do you know that your programs work correctly?
- They may run and produce some output, but you also need to test that it has worked as expected.
- We need to test our programs using sensible values to put into our programs to ensure that the outputs are what we expect.
*Error Handling*
[[file:img/Error_Handling_Info.png]]
*Types of Data to Test*
- There are *three* types of data that we should consider.:
  - *Normal (Typical) Data.*
  - *Boundary (Extreme) Data.*
  - *Erroneous Data.*
#+BEGIN_SRC
Normal(Typical) Data - Data that is valid and that represents how the program would
be used. It is data you are expecting, for instance if you are asking for an integer
between 3 and 20 you should test some data that is an integer between 3 and 20,
for instance 7.
#+END_SRC 
#+BEGIN_SRC
Boundary(Extreme) Data – Data that is just barely valid, to check that the extreme
ranges of normal input work correctly. It is data that is on the boundaries. If you
are asking for a number between 3 and 20 inclusive, then test 3 and 20 as well as 0
and 21 to check that the boundaries of the range are working as you expect.
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC
Erroneous Data – Data that should not be accepted by the system. It is data that is
just wrong. If you are asking for an integer test what happens when you enter a number
with a decimal point or a string?
#+END_SRC  

** Learn It: Test Planning
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
*Test Plan*
- The =best way= to approach =testing= is to =devise a test plan=, where we can =write down= the /sample data/ we will *use* to =ensure= that the /program works correctly/.
- The =main aim of testing= is to *identify errors* such as, /syntax, logical/ and /run-time errors/ as-well as /dealing/ with /invalid user inputs/ that *stops the program* from =working correctly=.
- The =first four columns= are *part of the design* and *planning stage* and the =final column= is *completed* when you *test the finished program*.
- *If numbers or dates* are being *added by the user*, then you =should use= *test data* that *checks*; /Normal (typical), Boundary (extreme)/ and /Erroneous data/.
- *Boundary data* =includes both ends= of the =allowed range=, as well as =data= that =should not be allowed=, just =outside this range=. (/i.e. 2 or 21/).

- We can perform some tests without the use of a computer or any of the real code.
- Often, when we write an algorithm, we'll want to test that it works correctly.
- We can use trace tables to achieve this.
#+begin_src
X <-- 1
Y <-- 2
WHILE X < 20
    OUTPUT X
    X <-- X + Y
    Y <-- Y + 1
ENDWHILE
#+end_src
- The variable in the above pseudocode algorithm can traced using a trace table.
| OUTPUT |  X | Y |
|--------+----+---|
|        |  1 | 2 |
|      1 |  3 | 3 |
|      3 |  6 | 4 |
|      6 | 10 | 5 |
|     10 | 15 | 6 |
|     15 | 21 | 7 |
- The trace table allows us to understand what is happening to the values of variables within the algorithm.
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Try drawing trace tables for the following algorithms.
#+begin_src
Y <-- 3
FOR X <-- 1 TO 5
    Y <-- Y + X
ENDFOR
OUTPUT Y
#+end_src
#+begin_src
List <-- [10,8,3,5,6,1,2]
Total <-- 0
FOR i <-- 1 TO LEN(List)
    TOTAL <-- TOTAL + List[i]
ENDFOR
OUTPUT TOTAL
#+end_src
#+begin_src
num <-- 78
answer <-- ''
WHILE num > 0
    r <-- num MOD 2
    num <-- num / 2
    answer <-- STR(r) + answer 
ENDWHILE
OUTPUT answer
#+end_src
#+begin_src
nums = [6,2,8,1,9,2]
n = 0
FOR i <-- 1 TO LEN(nums)
    IF nums[i] > n
        n = nums[i]
    ENDIF
ENDFOR
OUTPUT n
