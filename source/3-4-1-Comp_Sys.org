** Learn It: What is a Computer System?

- A computer system is made up of both =hardware= and =software= components and is capable of:
 - *Data Input* – Allowing users to input the instructions using =input devices=,
 - *Data Processing* – Using a microprocessor, typically the =Central Processing Unit (CPU)= to process instructions,
 - *Data Storage* – Storing user instructions,
 - *Data Output* – Output processed instructions using =output devices=.
 - *Data Transmission* - Ensuring that data can be transferred to or from another computer system
- As well as the personal computer, this definition applies to any equipment which uses computer technology.
[[file:img/Comp_Sys.png]]

- *Hardware* is any =physical components= that make up the computer.
- *Software* is any =program= that =runs= on the computer.
- Computer systems are all around us. They are not just =desktop PCs=,
  but also include =mobile phones=, =tablets=, =supermarket
  tills=, =ATM cash machines= and =engine management systems= in modern day cars.

Hardware is the physical parts of the computer that you can touch.
#+END_SRC
- The hardware on a computer are the components of a computer you can physically touch. This includes the computer itself, the parts inside the computer and any peripherals (i.e. things that are attached to the computer):
 - Monitor,
 - Keyboard,
 - Mouse,
 - Computer Case,
 - Printer,
 - Graphics card,
 - Power supply unit,
 - Motherboard,
 - CPU,
 - RAM,
 - Storage (HDD, DVD-ROM).

#+BEGIN_SRC
Software are the programs that control how the computer works.
#+END_SRC
- Software is any program that runs on a computer system. It can be
  grouped into *two main* categories:
 - *System Software:* Programs that are needed to enable the computer
   to function, including the =operating system=, =utilities software=,
   =library routines= and =programming language translators=.
- *Application Software:* Programs that enable a user to perform particular
  tasks like; =word processing=, =spreadsheet calculations=, =databases management=,
  =gaming=, =web browsing=, =mobile phone apps=, =graphics design=,
  =programming=, =music editing= and many more programs for specific
  applications such as =payroll=, =accounts=, =air traffic control=
  etc.

- Some people find it easy to remember the difference between the hardware and software of a computer system if they think of them in terms of the human body and their thoughts. 
- The body, brain and all the mushy bits inside us could be compared to the hardware of our system, these are the bits we could touch. Our thoughts, dreams and feelings could be compared to the software of our human system.
- You cannot have a living and functioning person without both the hardware and the software working together. It is the same in a computer system; it needs both the hardware and the software to be working together for the computer system to function correctly.
