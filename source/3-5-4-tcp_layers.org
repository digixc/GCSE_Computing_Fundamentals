** Learn It: The Concept of using Layers
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- The *TCP/IP Model* consists of =four layers=, each =containing= a number of =protocols=, creating a modular design with *each layer* being *responsible* for a *small part* of the /communication process/.
- The advantage of this modular design is that it lets suppliers such as *Micorsoft* or *Apple* easily adapt the protocol software to specific hardware and operating systems.
- For example, software for an =Ethernet system= can be *adapted* to an *optical-fibre* network by *changing* only the =link layer= and *not affecting* any of the *other layers*.
- =Packets of data= are *sent* down through the *layers*, =protocols= at each layer *perform their individual functions*, such as =breaking down= and
  =re-packaging= the *data* into *smaller units*, which are then *passed* to the *layer below*.
- *Data* is then *transmitted* =across the network= and at the *receiving end*, the *packets* are then =reassembled= and =passed back-up= through the *layers* to the /application they are intended for/.

*Network Protocols:*
 - When we talk about *Network Protocols*, we mean the =rules= devices have to follow in *order* to *communicate* with *each other* when they are /requesting and providing data and services/.
- With a complicated process such as =sending data packets=, *rules*, called *protocols*, are *essential*.

** Learn It: Advantages of using Layers
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- *Networking technologies* are *separated* or compartmentalised into *layers*, *each one* containing =specific= /hardware/ and /software/ =protocols=.
- =Each layer= *performs specific tasks* and =interacts= with *adjacent layers* in the network model.
*The advantages of this approach are:*
1. It simplifies the overall model by dividing it into four parts.
2. Each layer is specialised to perform a particular function.
3. The different layers can be combined in different ways as required.
4. One layer can be developed or changed without affecting the other layers.
5. It makes it easier to identify and correct networking errors and problems.
6. It provides a universal standard for hardware and software manufacturers to follow, so that they will be able to communicate with each other.
