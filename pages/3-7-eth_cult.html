Ethical Issues - There are several laws that govern the use of computer systems and data.
However, ethics is about good practice and behaving in a morally correct way.
Ethical actions are different from lawful actions. Sometimes actions can be legal, but
are they ethical?
</pre>
<p>
<b>Ethical Issues</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Computers have become so widespread that it is difficult to imagine a world without them.
</li>
<li>How much of an impact have they had on our culture and society?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>For Example:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ethical issues are ignored with our ever increasing use of technology.
</li>
<li>It is becoming more socially accpetable to use technology online to be rude or bully strangers that we haven't even met.
</li>
<li>Has technology made us a more or less caring society?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Q1. Think of some other ways in which computer technology has changed the way in which we live and work?</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>There are some benefits:</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many more people are now able to communicate with a much larger world through the use of social media, communication is possible
</li>
</ul>
<p>
between countires and people have access to a ealth of information through the Internet.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is also benefits to safety as it is easier than it used to be for a person who is in danger to seek help.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Here are some drawbacks:</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mobile phones make it much easier for people to put their own privacy at risk, since photos and personal information can be
</li>
</ul>
<p>
shared on social media platforms.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There are ethical issues relating to equality of access to technology, where more advanced technology is not available to
</li>
</ul>
<p>
less affluent people which creates what is known as the digital divide.

Technological Developments - Computer technology is vital in today's society. Technology
has given us many benefits such as 5G, Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, Artificial
Intelligence, Regenerative medicine, Driverless vehicles, Cryptocurrency, Quantum
computing, Digital Assistants, Robots, Smart Devices and automation are a few of the many
technologies available. However, technology also has a wide variety of negative impacts,
such as health issues, less social interactions, over reliance on technology, environmental
pollution and increased use of energy to power the huge number of electronic devices.
</pre>
<p>
<b>Recent Technological Developments</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>The Mixed Reality(MR):</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Mixed Reality</b> is the <code>combination</code> of <b>twin technologies</b> of <code>Virtual Reality (VR)</code> and <code>Augmented Reality (AR)</code>.
</li>
<li>Mixed reality (MR), <b>sometimes referred</b> to as <code>polyplexity (PP)</code>, is the <b>merging</b> of <code>real</code> and <code>virtual worlds</code> to <b>produce</b> <i>new environments</i> and <i>visualisations</i> where <code>physical</code> and <code>digital</code> <b>objects co-exist</b> and <b>interact</b> in <code>real-time</code>.
</li>
<li><b>Mixed reality</b> not only <b>takes place</b> in the <code>physical world</code> or the <code>virtual world</code>, but is a <code>hybrid of reality</code> and <code>virtual reality</code>, <b>encompassing both</b> <code>Augmented Reality</code> and <code>Augmented Virtuality</code> via <code>immersive technology</code>.
</li>
<li>The <b>first immersive mixed reality system</b>, providing enveloping <i>sight, sound</i>, and <i>touch</i> was the <code>Virtual Fixtures platform</code> developed at the <code>U.S. Air Force's Armstrong Laboratories</code> in the <i>early 1990s</i>.
</li>
<li><b>In a study published in 1992</b>, the <code>Virtual Fixtures project</code> at the U.S. Air Force <code>demonstrated</code> for the first time that <code>human performance</code> could be <code>significantly amplified</code> by the <b>introduction</b> of <b>spatially</b> <i>registered virtual objects overlaid on top of a person's direct view of a real physical environment</i>.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Artificial Intelligence(AI):</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With the onset of Artificial Intelligence, the machines are programmed to conduct the tasks that were restricted to the human mind. The artificial intelligence-based software can think intelligently like humans.
</li>
<li>The subsets of artificial intelligence like machine learning and
deep learning are gaining constant popularity among
businesses. Now, more and more companies are taking machine
learning development services as a necessity.
</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence improvises business tasks and makes them simple. It has provided the web app developers a brilliant support to experiment. This has made AI to reach healthcare, banking, education, mathematics, etc.

<li><b>IBM Deep Blue:</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Deep Blue</b> was a <code>chess-playing computer</code> developed by <b>IBM</b>. It is known for being the <code>first computer chess-playing system</code> to <b>win both a chess game</b> and a <b>chess match</b> against a <code>reigning world champion</code>.
</li>
<li><b>Deep Blue</b> <code>won</code> its <code>first game</code> against a <b>world champion</b> on the <code>10th February 1996</code>, when it <code>defeated</code> <i>Garry Kasparov</i> in game one of a <code>six-game match</code>. <b>However</b>, <code>Kasparov</code> <b>won three</b> and <b>drew two</b> of the following five games, <code>defeating Deep Blue</code> by a <b>score of 4–2</b>.
</li>
<li><b>Deep Blue</b> was then <code>heavily upgraded</code>, and <b>played Kasparov again</b> in <code>May 1997</code>.
</li>
<li>Deep Blue <b>won game six</b>, therefore <code>winning</code> the <b>six-game rematch 3½–2½</b> and becoming the <code>first computer system</code> to <b>defeat</b> a <code>reigning world champion</code>.
</li>
<li><b>Kasparov</b> <code>accused IBM of cheating</code> and <b>demanded a rematch</b>. <i>IBM refused and dismantled Deep Blue</i>.

<li><b>Google DeepMind AlphaGo:</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>AlphaGo</b> is a <code>computer program</code> that <b>plays</b> the <b>board game</b> <code>Go</code>.
</li>
<li>It was developed by Alphabet Inc.'s <code>Google DeepMind</code> in London.
</li>
<li>AlphaGo had <code>three far more powerful successors</code>, called <i>AlphaGo Master, AlphaGo Zero</i> and <i>AlphaZero</i>.
</li>
<li><b>In October 2015</b>, the original <code>AlphaGo</code> became the <code>first computer Go program</code> to <code>beat</code> a <code>human professional Go player</code> without handicaps on a full-sized 19×19 board.
</li>
<li><b>In March 2016</b>, it <code>beat</code> <b>Lee Sedol</b> in a <i>five-game match</i>, the <code>first time a computer Go program</code> has <b>beaten</b> a <code>9-dan professional</code>.
</li>
<li><b>Although,* it <code>lost</code> to *Lee Sedol</b> in the <code>fourth game</code>, Lee resigned in the final game, giving a <i>final score of 4 games to 1 in favour of AlphaGo</i>.
</li>
<li>In <b>recognition</b> of the <b>victory</b>, <code>AlphaGo</code> was <i>awarded an honorary 9-dan by the Korea Baduk Association</i>.
</li>
<li><b>At the 2017 Future of Go Summit</b>, its <b>successor</b> <code>AlphaGo Master,* =beat Ke Jie</code>, the <code>world No.1 ranked player</code> at the time, in a three-game match (<i>the even more powerful AlphaGo Zero already existed but was not yet announced</i>).
</li>
<li>After this, <code>AlphaGo</code> was <i>awarded professional 9-dan by the Chinese Weiqi Association</i>.

<li>These <b>applications</b> have <b>spread</b> to both the <code>customer</code> and <code>industrial domains</code>. In the area of safety and customer experience, IoT is witnessing exponential demands.
</li>
<li><b>Every second</b> <code>over 127</code> <i>new devices</i> will be <code>connected</code> to the <code>Internet</code>, according to David Evan’s calculations (<i>former researcher of CISCO</i>). This gives an idea about the constantly increasing reach of <b>IoT</b>.
</li>
<li>It is <code>estimated</code> that <code>over 90% automobiles</code> by <b>2020</b> <i>will be IoT enabled</i>. Moreover, according to the data found by Statista, there were around <code>23.14 billion devices</code> in <b>2018</b> and the <code>number</code> <i>will reach</i> <code>26.66 billion by 2019</code>.

</ul>
<pre class="example">
Your car is driving at a moderate speed down a road. It turns a corner and there are five
pedestrians standing in the road. Even if the car were to apply its brakes, it would still
hit them, so the only way to avoid killing the pedestrians is to mount the pavement.
Unfortunately, there is a single pedestrian standing on the pavement, who will be killed
if the car chooses to swerve.
</pre>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Should the car continue in a straight line and kill 5 people, or should it make a decision to intentionally kill a single individual?
</li>
<li>Write down what you think the car should do and why?
</li>
<li>If it was later discovered that the car should have been driving more slowly, who is to blame? Is it the fault of the owner of the car, the manufacturer of the car, the programmer of the car, or the program?
</li>
<li>Should computers be programmed to always serve humanity and therefore choose options that lead to the greatest good?

<pre class="example">
Cloud Storage - Is a cstorage method in which data is stored on remote servers and accessed
from the internet, or "cloud." It is maintained, operated and managed by a cloud storage
service provider.
</pre>
<p>
<b>What is Cloud Storage?</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Cloud storage involves uploading data to a remote server or computer via an Internet connection.
</li>
<li>This data storage system is maintained by a third party, for example: Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Apple iCloud.
</li>
<li>Instead of saving data on your computer's hard drive or other local storage device, you save it in a remote storage facility, and access it via the Internet.
</li>
<li>Clients pay for online storage space to which they can upload data such as photos, videos, music and documents.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>There are several advantages of cloud storage:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is a reduced risk of physical damage.
</li>
<li>You can access the data anytime and from anywhere in the World.
</li>
<li>You can share the data with other people in different locations.
</li>
<li>Backups are no longer an issue, as it is the responsibility of the provider to keep the data safe.
</li>
<li>It is a secure form of storage - As long as the password is kept private.
</li>
<li>Storage capacity on your local machine is freed up, giving you more storage space.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>There are also some disadvantages of cloud storage:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You must have an Internet connection to access your data.
</li>
<li>Data is at risk of hacking.
</li>
<li>Basic storage plans are usually free, but larger storage capacities often require payment.
</li>
<li>The speed at which you can access your data is limited by your Internet connection, therefore it might take a long time to upload and download large files.

<pre class="example">
The Digital Divide - A digital divide is any uneven distribution in the access to, use of,
or impact of information and communication technologies between any number of distinct
groups; these groups may be defined based on social, geographical, or geopolitical criteria,
or otherwise.
</pre>
<p>
<b>What is The Digital Divide?</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>People</b> <code>without access to technology</code>, or <code>who do not know how to use technology</code>, are at a <b>disadvantage</b> to those who do. <i>This is known as the digital divide</i>.
</li>
<li><b>There is</b> a <code>digital divide</code> <b>between</b> <code>countries</code> and <b>also between</b> <code>individuals</code> <i>within the same country</i>.
</li>
<li><b>For example</b>, in <code>England</code>, there are <code>areas without</code> <b>high speed Internet access</b>.
</li>
<li>The digital divide can have a <code>huge impact</code> on <b>people</b> who have <code>little</code> or <code>limited access</code> to <b>digital technologies</b>.
</li>
<li>Having <code>low IT literacy</code> can <code>lead</code> to <code>low-paid employment</code> or even <code>being unemployed</code>.
</li>
<li>The <code>Office for National Statistics</code> has <code>calculated</code> that in <b>2015</b> <code>over 3.5 million households</code> in the <code>UK</code> <b>had no Internet access</b>.
</li>
<li><b>In 2013</b>, it was <code>estimated</code> by the <code>charity Age UK</code> that it <code>costs households</code> <b>without Internet access</b> an <code>extra £276 per year</code>, <i>because they cannot shop or pay bills online</i>.
</li>
<li><b>38%</b> of those <code>who are not online</code> are also <b>unemployed</b> but:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>From 2013 they have had to prove that they are actively searching for jobs online using the government’s Universal Jobmatch website.</i>
</li>
<li><i>If they do not do this, their benefits can be stopped. Therefore they have to travel to libraries for access.</i>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Some of the main causes of the digital divide in the UK are:</b>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Money</b> - People need money to access the internet and buy the latest devices, such as computers, smartphones and tablets.
</li>
<li><b>Location</b> - Access to network coverage and high-speed broadband can vary greatly depending on where you live. Most large towns and cities have good network coverage and access, but rural areas can have limited or no coverage. Without these connections, the internet can be slow or non-existent.
</li>
<li><b>IT Literacy</b> - Knowing how to use technology empowers people to make the most of it. People who don't know how to use computers and the internet do not have the opportunities that IT-literate people do.
</li>
<li><b>Internet Access</b> - The Internet provides many opportunities for people who want to access online shopping, banking and job adverts. Students with internet access at home can research or revise with online help. Many universities and schools offer courses online. Social networking helps people make connections and stay in touch.

<li>Chess is a two-player board game. Every year there is a competition to find the best chess-playing computer program. In 2011 the chess program Rybka was accused of having copied program code from other chess-playing computer programs and was disqualified from the World Computer Chess Championship. Prize money won in previous years had
to be returned.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a) To date, it has never been proven or disproven that Rybka contained copied program code. State two reasons why it could be difficult to prove if program code in Rybka had been copied from another program.
</li>
<li>b) The program code that Rybka was accused of copying was open-source, this means that it was publically available so that anyone could look at it. The programmers of Rybka could have tried to prove they were innocent by publishing all their program code. This would allow people to compare it to the code they were accused of copying and see that it was different. Assuming that there was not any copied program code in Rybka, state one reason why the programmers might not want to do this.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some people believe that copying program code without permission should not be a crime. State one reason why they might believe this and state one reason why some people would disagree with them.
